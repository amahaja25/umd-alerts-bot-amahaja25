                 Dear campus community,
The 2023 Annual Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.","Dear campus community,

The 2023 Annual Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

Printed copies of the ASR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-6399.

Printed copies of the AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

We hope you will read the reports carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

                 Dear Campus Community,","Dear Campus Community,



One of the things I look forward to with the start of the spring semester is sharing with you updates from the department and reminders on how to Be a Safe Terp. Since I wrote to you last spring, much has happened. With that being said, I share with you information about new initiatives, and updates on ongoing initiatives, safety resources, and upcoming community events. We know that the first few weeks of classes can be overwhelming, but know this, we are here for you.

For many of us, we are still grappling with a video depicting a horrific killing of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police officers. I condemn their criminal misconduct in the strongest possible words. As an officer of the law for more than 50 years, it sickens me too, and I grieve alongside our community.

I am grateful to Nyumburu, MICA and the Black Faculty Staff Association for holding an event yesterday where we could grieve together.

Much work is to be done across the country, but here in College Park, our commitment to working with all of you to be a department of excellence has never been stronger. We continue to work with our campus partners in Enhancing Safety and Community Policing at the University of Maryland. You can see the progress on the online dashboard.

As we returned to a normal on campus resident population back in the fall, which was a first since the start of the pandemic in 2020, we anticipated seeing an increase in the number of calls for service and incidents. As expected, we did see an increase. In 2022, we responded to 103,453 calls for service compared to 98,061 in 2021. As we finalized the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, Part-I crime statistics for 2022, I share with you that we had 228 Part-I crime reports which yielded a 33.33% increase in overall crime compared to 2021 (171 Part-I crime reports). The majority of this increase is due to property crimes such as theft, burglary, and motor vehicle theft.

New and Ongoing Initiatives

Transparency and communication are crucial in building and maintaining trust. One of the ways we exhibit this is by making our crime stats available on our website. For decades, our department has reported our crime stats to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, Summary Reporting System (SRS) - an aggregate monthly totals. In 2021, the FBI retired the SRS and transitioned to a National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) - a new national data collection standard. After months of planning and coordination between our Records and IT unit, we have made the switch to NIBRS reporting. This switch makes sure we are meeting federal data standards, improving operations, and better informing the public about the nature of crime in our community. We will continue to publish our crime stats monthly on our website. More information about the switch to NIBRS can be viewed here.

As the first police department in the State of Maryland to partner with Lights On! this past February, we are proud to be part of a community-driven program that offers vouchers for free, up to $250 worth of repairs, instead of traffic tickets. Since joining Lights On!, we have issued over 100 vouchers to motorists with light(s) out on their vehicle.

Working with our partners in the Division of Student Affairs, we are coming up with innovative solutions to address the needs of the community as it relates to mental health. As I shared last year, we have a Crisis Intervention Team. We now have 21 officers and 911 call takers trained specifically in the field of Crisis Intervention and are using de-escalation techniques that improve the safety for our community and the officers involved. We are continuing to provide this additional training to all of our officers and 911 call takers.

Another resource that is available not to just public safety but all members of our community is the The BETA (Behavior Evaluation and Threat Assessment) Team. The BETA Team, led by the Division of Student Affairs, has expertise from various functional areas across campus. They evaluate reports about University of Maryland community members who behave in a concerning manner. Early intervention is important. See something, say something, do something. We invite you to review their resources on how to assist those in distress. The University also offers Mental Health and First Aid Training. This 8-hour training gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem and help connect them to the appropriate care.

Other measures expand Move Over Law and allow 24-hour temporary registration","MDOT MVA Bills Focused on Child Safety and Extended Renewals Among Laws Taking Effect on October 1

Other measures expand Move Over Law and allow 24-hour temporary registration

GLEN BURNIE, MD (September 29, 2022) – The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration (MDOT MVA) is alerting customers of several new bills taking effect October 1, including two – Senate Bill 176 and Senate Bill 218 – that were introduced by MDOT MVA leadership, passed by the General Assembly and signed into law earlier this year by Governor Larry Hogan.

The first measure is designed to help protect infants and toddlers in the event of a crash while also providing caregivers with clear guidance on child passenger safety. Senate Bill 176 requires a child under age 2 being transported in a motor vehicle to be secured in a rear-facing child safety seat that complies with federal regulations until the child reaches the manufacturer’s weight or height limit for the child safety seat. More information and resources can be found through MDOT MVA’s Highway Safety Office here.

The second measure, Senate Bill 218, allows MDOT MVA to issue a temporary renewal for qualified individuals for up to two years for driver’s licenses and identification (ID) cards. The bill was introduced by MDOT MVA as a result of lessons learned during COVID-19.

Prior to enactment of Senate Bill 218, MDOT MVA could only extend driver’s licenses and ID cards for 90 days, which was not sufficient under certain circumstances, for instance active-duty military members, students studying outside the state, and those who are at risk during state of emergency. Increasing the temporary renewal period gives customers more flexibility when they are unable to visit a branch office.

“MDOT MVA is not only committed to improving our customer’s experience when conducting agency business, but also to providing education to prevent motor vehicle injuries and fatalities,” said MDOT MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer, who also serves as Governor Larry Hogan’s Highway Safety Representative. “Our team did a tremendous job turning challenges presented during the pandemic into opportunities for the agency to implement customer-oriented changes and ensuring our most vulnerable road users are receiving the utmost protection while traveling.”

Another key measure taking effect October 1 is Senate Bill 147, which expands Maryland’s Move Over Law. The revision requires drivers to move over or slow down when approaching any vehicle that is stopped or parked and displaying hazard warning lights, road flares or other caution signals. Previously, the “move over or slow down” provision applied only when approaching law enforcement vehicles, tow trucks and emergency response vehicles and equipment.

Another new law is the result of House Bill 222, and requires the driver of a vehicle traveling slower than the general speed of traffic on an interstate highway in a rural area to drive the vehicle in the right-hand lanes. The law also mandates that MDOT MVA include information about this requirement in the state’s driver education curriculum.

Several other bills taking effect October 1 have an impact on MDOT MVA’s processes. House Bill 1076 allows MDOT MVA to issue an electronic 24-hour registration to the new owner of a vehicle to allow transport of the vehicle home after purchase. House Bill 368 requires MDOT MVA to allow a 10-day grace period for a customer to return or provide paperwork for registration tags to be returned before issuing a penalty for lapse of insurance following cancellation of a vehicle’s policy.

Other bills going into effect on October 1 related to motor vehicle operations include:

HB 0157 : Vehicle Laws – Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicles – Reserved Parking Spaces prohibits anyone from stopping, standing or parking a vehicle in a parking space designated for plug-in electric drive vehicles.

prohibits anyone from stopping, standing or parking a vehicle in a parking space designated for plug-in electric drive vehicles. HB 0679 : Vehicle Laws – Licensing of Businesses and Occupations – Definition of Vehicle Salesman requires anybody who negotiates with a person to enter into a financial security or warranty agreement on behalf of a dealer to obtain a salesman license.

requires anybody who negotiates with a person to enter into a financial security or warranty agreement on behalf of a dealer to obtain a salesman license. HB 1150: Vehicle Equipment – Highway Maintenance and Service – Green Flashing Lights allows certain highway maintenance and service equipment and vehicles, while in use for snow removal or the protection of highway maintenance workers, to be equipped display green flashing lights simultaneously with yellow or amber flashing lights. The change eliminates a restriction of these types of lights that previously existed.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

Printed copies of the ASR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-6399.

Printed copies of the AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

We hope you will read the reports carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

As we continue to go about our day-to-day activities while navigating the unknown that is this pandemic, I want to share with you what we have been working on these last couple of months. My hope is that this information not only provides insight into our department but also provides opportunities for a more community-centered approach to safety and security. And most importantly, I hope this update helps you keep yourselves and our community safe.

While our campus was operating in a de-densified capacity for all 2020 and the first half of 2021 due to COVID, we, as expected, saw a decrease in crime on campus. As we finalized the Uniform Crime Report, Part-I crime statistics for 2021, I share with you that overall crime fell to 4.47%, with a 4% decrease in property crimes.

New and Ongoing Initiatives

We are excited to announce our partnership with Lights On! This is a community-driven program that offers repair vouchers instead of traffic tickets for participating law enforcement agencies and communities they serve. Officers can provide drivers with vouchers redeemable for free repairs of broken lights at University Gas 2 Go, located at 8153 Baltimore Avenue, College Park, MD.

Safety and security are a community effort. One way we can achieve this goal is through Be Smart. Be Safe. This coordinated effort is a situational awareness safety campaign that emphasizes how Terps can be safe. When coupled with See Something, Say Something, we are reminded that we all play an active role in safety at Maryland.

A new program for the department is our Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). Currently, we have 12 officers who are trained specifically in the field of Crisis Intervention and are able to interact with crisis situations using de-escalation techniques that improve the safety for our community and the officers involved. This program offers many benefits to public safety, the University’s Mental and Behavioral health services, the UMD community, and the families of the UMD community.

All UMPD officers receive training pertaining to individuals in crisis. However, our Crisis Intervention Officers received additional training in the areas of:

• Recognizing when those signs and symptoms represent a crisis situation

• Safely de-escalating individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis

• Utilizing community resources and diversion strategies that are available to provide emergency assistance

This past fall, we successfully continued our accreditation efforts from The Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA®) and were reaccredited. A voluntary process, CALEA is an independent organization that reviews our policies and procedures and ensures we are in compliance with their standards. Since November 23, 1996, we have been accredited, and we are proud to have maintained The Gold Standard in Public Safety for 25 years!

I encourage our community to take advantage of other services and resources available, including the UMD Guardian App.

University’s Comfort Dog

Teddy the Terp is ecstatic that our community is back for the spring semester. While Teddy is still going through his training to become a certified comfort dog, members of our community can make a request for Teddy to attend any upcoming meetings, events, or even a one on one session. Just email Teddy at teddytheterp@umpd.umd.edu and his handler, Officer Melissa Fischer will respond for scheduling. You can follow Teddy on Instagram at @teddytheterp.

Our Service K-9s

After nearly 10 years of service to the University of Maryland and surrounding communities, our Explosives Detection K-9s, Jimbo, Bracken, and Pink have retired. The fourth dog, K-9 Chief, would have been retiring with them, but sadly passed away after his battle with cancer in 2019. Some of their biggest accomplishments include protecting Terp fans during nine seasons of Maryland Football and Basketball games. Additionally, the dogs would patrol the University of Maryland campus daily, working to keep our facilities and our students, faculty, staff and guests safe. We wish them happiness in their next stages in life as civilian pets with their handlers and their family.

The retirement of three dogs can only mean one thing. Please welcome our three newest members, K-9s Hera, Hercules, and Buzz, to the University of Maryland community. You can expect to see them around campus, conducting trainings and assisting at special events and more. Unlike Teddy, these are working dogs, so we ask that you save your belly rubs for Teddy. But, please engage with the dogs’ handlers; they love talking with members of our community about their partner and how they help keep us safe from evolving threats.

Student Job Opportunities

Come be part of the tradition of Terps Protecting Terps! Students can work as Student Police Aides in our Student Police Auxiliary or Monitors in our Security Operations Center. All majors are welcomed for both positions.

In Conclusion

Since 1975, we have been here serving our community. Answering the call time and time again. We are here for you 24/7/365, and always will be. Protecting Maryland’s Future.

BRIEF DETAILS:

We write to you this evening to make you aware of multiple incidents of fraud (scams) that have been reported in our area.

Since September, we have received five reports of fraud with the most recent incident reported to the University of Maryland Police Department on October 14, 2021. The victims in these cases are University affiliated.

Below is a summary of the incidents that were reported to police:

One victim received a phone call from an individual claiming to be from a foreign government entity who had a warrant for their arrest.

The other four victims were defrauded over various social media apps. In one instance an individual claimed to be an investor who made false guarantees of financial gain. In the remaining three incidents, each victim engaged in a consensual conversation with an unknown individual on-line. The individual then threatened to release photos of the victim if they didn’t pay the individual.



In all of these incidents, a scammer made false accusations paired with fear tactics to convince the victim to buy gift cards and/or send US currency as payment in order to avoid any further action taken against them.

The University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Criminal Investigations Unit are investigating these incidents.

Individuals with any information regarding these incidents are encouraged to contact police at 301-405-3555. Individuals wishing to remain anonymous may email http://www.umpd.umd.edu/contact/anonymous_tip.cfm .

When available for release, additional information, may be obtained by accessing the ""UMD Safety Notice"" portion of our web site: http://universityofmarylandpolice.com/stats/safety_notices.cfm and http://umpdnews.umd.edu/home

It is important to remember the following tips:

Scammers pretend to be from an organization you know. Such as the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Medicare, police, etc.

Scammers always say there is a problem. They might say you’re in trouble with the government, you owe money, you have a warrant, or a problem with your bank account.

Scammers pressure you to act immediately. They want you to act before you think. They will tell you not to hang up the phone, threaten to arrest you, deport you, or threaten to hack your information. Just to name a few.

Scammers will tell you to pay in a specific way. They often tell people to send money through a money transfer company or purchase gift cards and have you read the back of the gift card number to them, or they will tell you that they will send you a check (that will later turn out to be fake), tell you to deposit it and then send them the money.

If you believe you are a victim of a scam, contact UMPD to file a report at 301-405-3555. You may also file a report with the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint, or call 877-382-4357.

Safety Tips:

Don’t give out Personal Identifying Information (PII), such as Social Security Number or government issued photo to scammers. They can use this information to steal your identity and open accounts in your name.

Don’t send photos of yourself to scammers. They will use the photo and release it to people you know and on-line.

Gift cards are for gifts, NOT payments.

The IRS will never call to demand payment, such as prepaid debt cards, gift cards, wire transfer or bitcoin. Neither will Law Enforcement/Immigration. Generally, the IRS will first mail you a bill if you owe taxes.

If you find yourself on the phone with a scammer, hang up. Call the police to report the incident.

If you received an email, don’t respond. Report the email as spam and call the police.

Trust your instincts. They are a natural gift that tells you when something is wrong.

If you observe suspicious activity or behavior, contact the police immediately by calling #3333 from a mobile phone or 301-405-3333.

The 2021 Annual Safety and Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies.

This report also reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

During 2020, the University of Maryland Community faced numerous challenges. Despite these challenges, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) continued to work on-campus 24/7, 7 days a week to serve and protect the university, ensuring campus safety was UMPD’s priority during a global pandemic. Throughout 2020, UMPD responded to over 94,000 calls for service; these include but are not limited to: responding to emergency and non-emergency calls, initiating traffic stops, conducting building checks across our campus community, responding to vehicle and building lockouts, investigating traffic accidents and providing walking escorts.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Emergency 911 Center

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Below is the warning from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that was published on March 30, 2021.

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today warned of an ongoing IRS-impersonation scam that appears to primarily target educational institutions, including students and staff who have "".edu"" email addresses.

The IRS' phishing@irs.gov has received complaints about the impersonation scam in recent weeks from people with email addresses ending in "".edu."" The phishing emails appear to target university and college students from both public and private, profit and non-profit institutions.

Taxpayers who believe they have a pending refund can easily check on its status at Where's My Refund? on IRS.gov.

The suspect emails display the IRS logo and use various subject lines such as ""Tax Refund Payment"" or ""Recalculation of your tax refund payment."" It asks people to click a link and submit a form to claim their refund.

The phishing website requests taxpayers provide their:

Social Security number

First Name

Last Name

Date of Birth

Prior Year Annual Gross Income (AGI)

Driver's License Number

Current Address

City

State/U.S. Territory

ZIP Code/Postal Code

Electronic Filing PIN

People who receive this scam email should not click on the link in the email, but they can report it to the IRS. For security reasons, save the email using ""save as"" and then send that attachment to phishing@irs.gov or forward the email as an attachment to phishing@irs.gov. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) and IRS Criminal Investigation have been notified.

Taxpayers who believe they may have provided identity thieves with this information should consider immediately obtaining an Identity Protection PIN. This is a voluntary opt-in program. An IP PIN is a six-digit number that helps prevent identity thieves from filing fraudulent tax returns in the victim's name.

Taxpayers who attempt to e-file their tax return and find it rejected because a return with their SSN already has been filed should file a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit PDF, to report themselves as a possible identity theft victim.

COVID-19 Testing Spring Requirements","What Terps Need to Know

From the University of Maryland, Division of Student Affairs

Community Expectations

COVID-19 Testing Spring Requirements

All students, faculty, and staff must attest to a COVID-19 test result before returning to campus.

Residence hall students are required to complete pre and post-arrival testing. They must attest negative COVID-19 test results within 10 days before move-in and no later than two weeks after on-campus arrival on Keep Terps Safe portal to enable building access.

Students living on or near campus will be required to be tested every two weeks in the spring semester.

Symptom Monitoring

Those returning to campus must continue to complete daily symptom monitoring on the UMD app or the Keep Terps Safe Portal (return.umd.edu). This is one of our key mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Face Coverings

As of January 16, 2021, Prince George’s County will require face coverings to be worn in all public places, outdoors or indoors, even where you are able to maintain 6 feet of distance from others. This means that in all locations on campus and the surrounding community, except for your private residence, a face covering must be worn at all times. Face coverings are not required during vigorous exercise outdoors.



Self-isolation/Quarantine for students returning to College Park

For the first two weeks of the semester, all courses will be online. Students are asked to sequester and limit in-person gatherings for two weeks after arrival to help mitigate the spread of the virus. All activities, events and programs will remain virtual during that time as we want to wait for students to be tested on campus before we begin to offer in person opportunities for engagement.

Spring Quarantine & Isolation Housing

Consistent with last semester, residential students who test positive or have been exposed to a close contact who has tested positive will need to move to quarantine and isolation housing in Leonardtown or on Fraternity Row. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has offered new quarantine guidelines. Students in quarantine or isolation will now be required to stay ten days, whether they are being quarantined for possible exposure or isolated with symptoms or a positive test result.

For Students Living in Residence Halls

New to housing residents move-in information

New-to-housing students are invited to move-in in advance of returning students on Thursday, January 21, and Friday, January 22, by appointment only. We encourage new students to return on one of these two days to settle in and participate in the Winter Welcome events. Move-in appointments are available through February 8.

Residents may log in to their Housing Portal for assignment and move-in scheduling details.

Returning residents move-in information

Residence Hall move-in for returning residents begins January 23 by appointment only. Appointments will extend through 2/8 for residents who wish to delay return.

Move-in appointment and pre-arrival negative COVID-19 test result activate the student ID to access the residence hall. If a residence hall student comes back early without an appointment, access will not work.

Returning residents should plan to complete a curbside drop off to alleviate congestion in the building and support the 4Maryland healthy behaviors.

Programs and Engagement Activities

Students are expected to limit their in-person interactions for the first two weeks of the spring semester and take another COVID-19 test before in-person instruction commences. These measures were implemented at the beginning of the fall semester and helped begin the academic year with as few positive cases as possible.

Students can have socially distanced conversations using face coverings in shared spaces on their assigned floor.

Students should wear face coverings outdoors and in public spaces and should not go to bars or restaurants, and they should not host or attend large gatherings and parties.

All programs, events, and activities will be held virtually in the first two weeks of the semester. We want to wait for students to be tested on campus before offering in-person opportunities for engagement.

For Students Living Off-Campus

Many virtual programs are scheduled, and all students are invited to attend. There will be no in-person programs and events during the first two weeks of the semester.

Essential on-campus services will be available for off-campus students.

Off-campus students are expected to follow similar guidelines as students living on campus. Students can leave their living quarters to exercise, buy groceries, or take care of essential functions only —as was done during the stay-at-home order.

There can be no social events, gatherings, or parties on or off-campus during this time.

Students should wear face coverings outdoors and in public spaces and should not go to bars or restaurants, and should not host or attend large gatherings and parties.

Engagement Opportunities

Weeks 1 & 2

All programs, events, and activities will be held virtually in the first two weeks of the semester.

Weeks 3 & 4

Limited in-person on-campus programming or events may be offered dependent upon PG County and public health guidance.

Detectives from the Prince George’s County Police Department are working to determine the circumstances that led to a fatal shooting Thursday evening in College Park.

The decedent was located in a parking lot suffering from gunshot wounds. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

The University has verified that the decedent has no UMD affiliation.

Anyone with information on this case is asked to call the Homicide Unit at 301-516-2512. Callers wishing to remain anonymous may call Crime Solvers at 1-866-411-TIPS (8477), or go online at www.pgcrimesolvers.com, or use the “P3 Tips” mobile app (search “P3 Tips” in the Apple Store or Google Play to download the app onto your mobile device.)

The 2020 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review.

The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies.

This report also reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

The University of Maryland Police Department is responsible for keeping the University of Maryland, College Park campus safe and secure. We do this in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department, working together to keep the surrounding areas safe and secure.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Emergency 911 Center

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Criminal Investigations Unit

Information Analysis Unit

Student Police Auxiliary

Building Security Services (BSS)

Crime prevention programs

Safe Terp Trade Zone (On-line Purchase Exchange Area)

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phones (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System (UMD Alerts)

UMD Guardian Safety App

ShotSpotter

AccuWeather

The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the ASR will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

To view the ASR, please visit:

http://www.umpd.umd.edu/stats/AnnualSecurityReport.pdf

Printed copies of the ASR may be obtained from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3555.

To view the Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR), please visit: http://www.essr.umd.edu/fire/report/. The purpose of this report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. Individual printed copies of the 2020 AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

As you review the resources listed in the ASR, please keep in mind that due to COVID-19, hours of operations may have changed for some departments. Please check each department’s website for the latest information.

We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, and a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

BRIEF DETAILS:

We write to you today to make you aware of multiple incidents of fraud (scams) that have been reported in our area.

Over the past two weeks, we have received four reports of fraud (scams). The victims in these cases are University Affiliated and were either contacted by email or by phone. In each case, the caller was pretending to be from a Government Agency, an Employer, an Electronic Company, and Law Enforcement/Immigration. The scammers made false accusations paired with fear tactics to convince the victims to buy gift cards and/or bitcoins as payment in order to avoid any further action taken against them.

Scammers will use different methods to contact a potential victim. The scammer may call, email, text message or even approach the potential victim in person. The goal of the scammer is to make up false accusations along with fear tactics or even pity to try to convince the potential victim to comply with the scammer’s demands. The scammer will often remain on the phone with the victim until they receive the gift card number and pin. Once they have that information, there is little chance a victim could get their money back.

However, there could be a chance that you could recover your money back by calling the company immediately after a scammer is paid. To learn more, click here. But remember, gift cards are for gifts (birthdays, holidays, etc.), not payments. Anyone who demands payment by gift card is a scammer. Scammers will also sometimes use multiple numbers and multiple people to contact victims to legitimize their fraudulent claims.

Here are some examples of various scams:

If someone you don’t know mails you a check or approaches you in person and asks you to cash a check for them — don’t. It’s a scam.

If someone you don’t know asks you to cash a check and use a wire transfer service to send the money back to them after cashing the check for them — don’t. It’s a scam.

You receive a call or email from a scammer claiming to be from a government agency (federal, state, or local) and you need to make a payment in order to avoid being jailed, deported, fined, or that you owe taxes — don't it's a scam.

You receive a call or email form a scammer that a family member is in need of help or has been kidnapped and demands gift cards in the form of payment — don’t. It’s a scam.

You receive a call or email from tech-support and they demand gift cards in the form of payment — don’t. It’s a scam.

If you receive an e-mail/text message from a known individual asking you to send them money, verify with that person first before sending them money. It could be a scam.

If you believe you are a victim of a scam, contact UMPD to file a report at 301-405-3555. You may also file a report with the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint, or call toll-free: 1-877-FTC-HELP.

Below are some resources and videos from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Please take a moment to review this helpful information and learn how you can STOP scams in their tracks!

Safety Tips:

Don’t not give out Personal Identifying Information (PII), such as Social Security Number, government issued photo or selfies to scammers. They can use this information to steal your identity and open accounts in your name. Never provide PII to someone you don’t know.

Gift cards are for gifts, NOT payments.

payments. The IRS will never call to demand payment, such as prepaid debt cards, gift cards, wire transfer or bitcoin. Neither will Law Enforcement/Immigration. The IRS will first contact you via the mail with a bill to any taxpayer that owes taxes.

If you find yourself on the phone with a scammer, hang up. If you received an email, don’t respond. Report the email as spam.

As you know, we are a bustling campus with many modes of transportation. Over the years and in partnership with the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) and our own Department of Transportation Services (DOTS), there have been many new measures implemented that have improved the safety of all those in our campus community.

And as a reminder, when you are traveling on and around campus you should Walk Smart, Bike Smart, Drive Smart and Scoot Smart.

Tips for Drivers:

Stay alert and give driving your full attention

Show courtesy to other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists

Comply with traffic laws and heed all traffic signs, signals and markings

Tips for pedestrians, cyclists and scooters:

Wear a helmet when operating a bicycle or an e-scooter

Keep your eyes up - put your phone away

Wear clothing that is light and reflective after dark

DOTS has a wealth of transportation safety information on their website, to include, but not limited to, campus bike guidelines. Please be sure to check it out.

It is particularly important that we, as a community understand the role we each play in keeping ourselves and those around us safe. We are committed to keeping our roadways safe though educational outreach and traffic enforcement, but we need your help. When everyone is doing their part, then together we can all make traveling around campus safe - no matter your mode of transportation.

				Aaron Nysus in Custody Again for New Charge of Burglary for Breaking into College Park Residence


					 






								



								Aaron Nysus




					 

					 

					The Prince Geor","Aaron Nysus

The Prince George’s County Police Department has once again arrested the man who broke into at least seven residences in College Park since November 16th. In at least five of the cases, he’s facing peeping tom charges. He’s 37-year-old Aaron Nysus of the 3400 block of Notre Dame Street in Hyattsville. Detectives took him into custody again this morning. He is facing a new charge of first-degree burglary. The PGPD had arrested him last Friday on five previous charges but he posted bail and was released from the Department of Corrections the same day.

Nysus is now charged in connection with a break in on November 16th at a residence in the 4600 block of College Avenue. In that case, one victim awoke to Nysus in the home, which is a sorority house. Nysus fled moments after the victim woke up. Detectives have since spoken to a second victim in that home who advised a personal item was taken during the break-in.

In the other incidents, PGPD officers were called to an apartment building in the 4300 block of Hartwick Road on December 8th. They spoke to a victim who told officers that at 5:45 am, she awoke to the sound of her front door opening. She went to investigate the noise but didn’t find anyone in her apartment. Detectives reviewed surveillance video from the building and saw that Nysus was the suspect who broke into her apartment. He also was seen on surveillance video checking the doors of approximately 25 apartments that same morning. He walked into three other apartments while inside of the building. He stayed in each of those apartments for several minutes. In each of those cases, residents were inside and unaware of his presence.

Through various investigative techniques, detectives identified Nysus and obtained an arrest warrant which was executed on December 13th. During the search of his home, items of evidence were also recovered linking him to a break-in in an apartment on November 17th in the 4000 block of Knox Road. In that case, the victim woke up to Nysus standing by her bed. He then ran from her apartment.

Nysus is now charged with first-degree burglary and five counts of trespassing/peeping tom and fourth degree burglary.

Please call detectives if you have information on Nysus or are concerned you’ve been victimized by Nysus. They can be reached at 301-699-2601.",2024-04-11T03:18:34.386343+00:00

Do not use a cable or a chain to secure your motor scooter as those are easily defeatable.

If you haven’t done so, make sure to register your motor scooter with DOTS.

Preliminarily, detectives believe the suspects targeted the victims because, at least, one of the victims is involved with the illegal sale of marijuana.

On November 11th, at approximately 7:15 pm, three suspects broke into the home in the 7400 block of Dickinson Avenue. At least two of the suspects had guns. The suspects demanded cash from the residents. Once they got the money, the suspects fled the home. No one was hurt.

The previous residential robbery occurred on October 30th on the same street, in the 7500 block of Dickinson Avenue at 10:40 pm. Preliminarily, detectives believe the house was targeted by two unknown suspects because, at least, one of the victims was involved in the illegal sale of marijuana.

“We wanted to address our community because we know there is concern, but we want to reiterate that these are not random crimes at all. So far the investigation has revealed the robberies, in both cases, surround individuals who are engaged in the illegal sale of marijuana and were targeted as a result of those criminal pursuits and activities,” said Chief Hank Stawinski.

At this time, there is no link between the victims in either case, however, detectives are working to determine whether the same suspects are responsible for both crimes.",2024-04-11T03:18:34.386343+00:00

UMPD CASE #: 2019-54657

BRIEF DETAILS:

On September 19, 2019, at approximately 10:28 a.m., the University of Maryland Police Department responded to the Mathematics Building for an unattended bag. Video footage from the mailroom revealed an unidentified male placing a bag on the floor and leaving. The Prince George’s County Fire Department was requested and responded for a suspicious package. The Mathematics Building and Glenn L. Martin Hall were evacuated as a safety precaution.

At approximately 12:17 p.m., an officer located the unidentified male (student) near the M Circle and brought him to investigators for follow up. It was determined that the male left the bag in the mailroom for safe keeping. The male intended to return at the end of the day to retrieve his property. The male also informed investigators that he left a second bag on the 3rd floor. The Prince George’s County Fire Department deemed both bags safe, no threat. At approximately 1:10 p.m., the buildings were reopened to resume daily operations. The male was released without charges.

I want to share with you how your police department continues to keep campus safe and how you can play a role in your safety and in the safety of your fellow Terps.
Our officers continue to be proactive and responsive in their duties while serving and protecting our campus community. In 2018, we responded to over 75,000 calls for service, which include but are not limited to responding to calls, initiating traffic stops, conducting building checks across our campus community, responding to vehicle and building lockouts, investigating traffic accidents, and walking escorts.
We continue to see a decrease in crime on our campus, with the crime rate falling almost 38 percent in 2018. This is in addition to an almost 7 percent drop in crime the year before. This includes an almost 42 percent drop in theft, our most reported crime on campus. Burglary incidents continue to decrease over the ten-year span, with 11 reports made last year. Though there has been a decrease in reported crimes, we still need your help. Here are a few things you can do:","Dear Campus Community,

I want to share with you how your police department continues to keep campus safe and how you can play a role in your safety and in the safety of your fellow Terps.

In 2018, we responded to over 75,000 calls for service, which include but are not limited to responding to calls, initiating traffic stops, conducting building checks across our campus community, responding to vehicle and building lockouts, investigating traffic accidents, and walking escorts.

This includes an almost 42 percent drop in theft, our most reported crime on campus. Burglary incidents continue to decrease over the ten-year span, with 11 reports made last year. Though there has been a decrease in reported crimes, we still need your help. Here are a few things you can do:

Do not let others into your residential building or onto floors, stairwells, elevators, etc. unless you know them as residents of your building.

Keep your room door locked, when you’re asleep, down the hall, in the bathroom, or visiting others in your building.

Don’t leave your property unattended.

If storing items inside a locker temporarily, use a lock to secure the locker.

If you have a bicycle on campus, use a “U” type of lock and not a cable/chain lock to secure your property.

To see the crime trend for the past ten years and the decreasing trend of crime on our campus, click here.

The safety of our community is a community effort. All members of the University of Maryland community play a role in keeping campus safe. Recently, a female student alerted UMPD of an intruder that was entering rooms inside Hagerstown Hall in the middle of the night. Thanks to the quick reporting by our student, our officers were able to apprehend the intruder and charge him accordingly.

If you see something, say something to police immediately. Do not wait; the sooner you report, the sooner our officers can respond and address the situation.

As part of our ongoing commitment to your safety, and our continuous efforts to educate you on emergency preparedness, we encourage you to review our latest safety video, Responding to an Active Shooter. While there’s no reason to expect to face an active shooter situation while you’re here, being prepared and understanding widely accepted practices are the best ways to be safe.

You can call UMPD or text us from the UMD Guardian Safety App, which is available free in the app store. This is the only way you can text UMPD . This app also serves as a virtual walking escort service, automatically contacting UMPD if you do not arrive at your expected destination.

As always, we ask that you register your cell phone with UMD Alerts by visiting https://www.alert.umd.edu/ . You will receive text messages from UMPD in the event of an active emergency.

Working together we can achieve a common goal: a safe campus.

Go Terps!

Special Love is a nonprofit organization that provides cancer families a community of support, made up of other patients and families who know and understand the trials and triumphs of the cancer experience.

Special Love strives to bring together children with cancer and their families for fellowship, friendship, and fun. Families on the pediatric cancer journey have an ally during and after the cancer experience. Each family member is included in programs: Family weekends give mom and dad a chance to share with other adults, and siblings have a program that gives them the attention they need and an opportunity to make their own friends.

Hospitals refer the families of children with cancer to Special Love. The communication among the patient, doctors, family, and Special Love staff assures the best interests of the child with cancer are well-represented and everyone has an understanding of the patient’s needs.

Traditionally, No Shave November is known as a men’s only event. However, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) wants all of their employees to have an opportunity to participate.

That is why all members of the police department will have the option to either grow their beards out or paint their fingernails in extreme or unnatural colors.

To donate to Special Love, Inc. click here. If you wish to learn more on How a Community Makes a Difference, watch this short video here.

So, if you see any of our police officers, staff or student police auxiliary members with bright color fingernail polish or more facial hair than usual, it’s because they are raising cancer awareness.",2024-04-11T03:18:34.386343+00:00

We write to you to make you aware of various scams that have been reported in our area.
There are different methods a scammer will use to contact a potential victim. The scammer may call, send an email or might even approach the potential victim in person. The goal of the scammer is to use fear or pity to try to convince the potential victim to comply with the scammer’s demands.
For example:


		If someone you don’t know mails you a check or approaches you in person and asks you to cash a check for them; don’t. It’s a scam.

		If someone you don’t know asks you to cash a check and use a wire transfer service to send the money back to them after cashing the check for them; don’t. It’s a scam.

		You receive a call from a scammer claiming to be from a government agency (federal, state, or local) and you need to make a payment in order to avoid being jailed, deported, fined, or that you owe taxes; or a family member is in need of help or tech-support and they demand gift cards in the form of payment; don’t. It’s a scam.

This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Rates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows year after year that the majority of misused and abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including someone else’s medication being stolen from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are now advised that their usual methods for disposing of unused medicines—flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash—both pose potential safety and health hazards.

For more information about the disposal of prescription drugs or about the October 27 Take Back Day event, go to www.DEATakeBack.com .

As you look over the statistics for 2017, you will see there are two murders reported. The first was the murder of 2nd Lt. Richard Collins, III, in which an arrest was made shortly thereafter. The accused is charged with murder and a hate crime and is expected to go to trial in January 2019.","Working Together for a Safe Campus

The 2018 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review.

The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where University students stay while on University-sponsored travel, traveling within the United States or abroad, area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department.

As you look over the statistics for 2017, you will see there are two murders reported. The first was the murder of 2nd Lt. Richard Collins, III, in which an arrest was made shortly thereafter. The accused is charged with murder and a hate crime and is expected to go to trial in January 2019.

The second murder occurred while a University of Maryland (UMD) student was traveling as part of a University-sponsored trip out-of-state. In the summer of 2018, in response to a Clery Act travel inquiry, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) was notified of a murder that occurred in the common area of a hotel in Chapel Hill, NC in February 2017. The student was staying in the hotel at the time of the murder. Clery Act regulations require that this crime is included in our statistics, as it occurred in a Non-Campus Property/Building for 2017. The student was not a victim, nor suspect in the incident.

There are a number of statistics worthy of mention. Burglary/B&E and Motor Vehicle Theft numbers have continued to decline to historic lows. The primary reasons for these results include the restructure of patrol service and camera surveillance enhancements. Furthermore, drug referrals and arrests remain at all-time lows due to the decriminalization in 2015 of small amounts of Marijuana in the State of Maryland. The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which, by far, is the most commonly, reported criminal offense on campus.

This report reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

The men and women of UMPD are responsible for keeping the UMD College Park campus safe and secure. We do this in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department, working together to keep the surrounding areas safe and secure.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Walking escorts

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phone (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System (UMD Alerts)

UMD Guardian Safety App

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Crime prevention programs

Criminal and traffic law enforcement, reporting, and investigation

Student Police Auxiliary

Emergency 911 center

In 2017 we created Safe Terp Trade Zone. Safe Terp Trade Zone is a safety resource that provides the buyer and seller a safe space to meet in person to complete their on-line purchase. Both parties can meet in the lobby of our police station or at our parking lot to conduct the exchange. More information about this program, visit https://umpdnews.umd.edu/node/934

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

A male UMD student reported to police that he was walking on the trail when a male came up behind him and announced a robbery. The victim gave the suspect his property. The suspect then left the area and was last seen heading south on the trail.

Due to the late reporting of this incident from the victim to police, a text alert was not sent.

The Maryland-National Capital Park Police is conducting an investigation. Individuals with any information regarding this incident or the possible identity of the suspect are encouraged to contact police (911 or 301-459-3232).

No action required.” WEA triggers a loud noise and text message on cell phones and enabled mobile devices.

Twenty jurisdictions will simultaneously issue a test message to the public through the WEA system. Local jurisdictions participating include: City of Alexandria, City of Bowie, City of College Park, City of Fairfax, City of Falls Church, City of Gaithersburg, City of Greenbelt, City of Takoma Park, City of Manassas, City of Manassas Park, City of Rockville, District of Columbia, Arlington County, Charles County, Fairfax County, Frederick County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, and Prince William County.

“Testing these notification systems is an important part of our preparedness system,” said Governor Larry Hogan. “During an imminent weather emergency or other serious threat, these alerts will save lives.”

During this test, it is possible that individuals may receive more than one alert message. Those who travel from one jurisdiction to another may hear messages from each jurisdiction. Also, people who live or travel in areas near the jurisdictions listed above may also receive the message because this technology uses cellular carrier towers.

Periodic testing of public alert and warning systems help assess the operational readiness of the system and identify any improvements. Public safety officials need to be sure that in times of an emergency or disaster, they have reliable methods and systems that will deliver urgent alerts and warnings to the public. Conducting a regional test supports the continued use, training, and improvement of the WEA system.

“Drills like these help us to ensure that our systems allow emergency managers to quickly communicate with you,” said Russ Strickland, executive director of MEMA. “During an incident, it is important to listen to messages and information from federal, state, and local officials and communicate any protective actions with your family, friends, and neighbors.”

Since its launch in 2012, the WEA system has been used more than 33,000 times nationwide to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical situations. Additional information on WEA is located at: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-emergency-alerts-wea.

As we near the halfway point in the academic year, I want to call your attention to safety resources available to our community and restate our unwavering commitment to campus safety.

In addition to the 85 University Police Officers protecting and serving the campus and the City of College Park, our Student Police Auxiliary (SPA) patrols campus and the City of College Park, in addition to staffing the gatehouses at night. We have more than 400 cameras in our community that are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including the addition of approximately 20 cameras in 2017.

This year, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) completed Fair and Impartial Policing training for all sworn officers. We have offered a reward for information leading to the identification of the individual(s) responsible for recent hate bias incidents at Ellicott Dining Hall, and we continue to encourage the community to contact us when witnessing incidents of hate in our community. We also launched Safe Terp Trade Zone, a safe space for buyers and sellers to complete online transactions in person at our Police Station.

I encourage you to download the UMD Guardian Safety App if you have not already done so. This can serve as a virtual walking escort service, automatically contacting UMPD if you do not arrive at your expected destination. In addition to DOTS Nite Ride, we offer a 24/hour walking escort service upon request for on or around campus by calling 301-405-3555.

In recent years, we added an Explosives Detection K9 unit, an Information Analysis Unit for online investigative support, gunshot location detection technology, and Automated License Plate Readers. We also expanded our concurrent jurisdiction into the surrounding community to better serve and protect the University community and surrounding areas. As always, we ask that you register your cell phone with UMD alerts by visiting https://www.alert.umd.edu/

As a university, we continuously invest in enhanced safety measures, and we want each of you to be aware of the many resources working to keep our community safe.

In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department.

The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which, by far, is the most commonly, reported criminal offense on campus. Other property crimes reportable through Clery include Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson. The men and women of the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) are responsible for keeping the

UMD campus safe and secure and in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department keeping the surrounding areas safe and secure. Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Walking escorts

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phone (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System (UMD Alerts)

UMD Guardian Safety App

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Crime prevention programs

Criminal and traffic law enforcement, reporting, and investigation

Student Police Auxiliary

Emergency 911 center

A new program for 2017 is the Safe Terp Trade Zone. Safe Terp Trade Zone provides the buyer and seller a safe space to meet in person to complete their on-line purchase. Buyers and sellers can meet in the lobby of our police station or at our parking lot to conduct the exchange. More information about this program, visit https://umpdnews.umd.edu/node/934

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

Printed copies of the Annual Safety and Security Report may be obtained from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 (301) 405-3555 upon request.

To view the Annual Fire Safety Report, please visit: http://www.essr.umd.edu/fire/report/. The purpose of this report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. Individual printed copies of the 2017 Annual Fire Safety Report may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

Although this publication mainly focuses on 2016, the murder of Second Lt. Richard Collins III in 2017 has called for the entire campus to come together in order to resolve differences and reaffirm the University’s core values of diversity, inclusion, respect, and civil discourse. The University is undertaking many initiatives aimed at promoting and protecting diversity within our community, including the launch of the Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force, the development of a trained rapid-response team for hate-bias incidents, and a review of the University’s Code of Student.

For more information on how you can be part of the conversation and solution, I strongly encourage you to visit https://www.umd.edu/UMDreflects. It is through our community that opposing ideals and values can come together to form one voice for positive change.

We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, but a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

This will be facilitated through education, interaction, and open discussion. UMPD will provide an informal academy experience to the participants, with classroom activities and discussion, as well as many hands-on experiences.

The informal class setting will encourage conversation among participants and police officers. Participants will be introduced to the academic and practical aspects of a police academy and they will become familiar with such topics as traffic law, crime scene investigations, and criminal law. There will also be an opportunity to participate in ride alongs with an officer. The academy experience will also include practical exercises and scenarios faced by police officers. This will be a unique experience to bring together, in a non-confrontational, learning environment, an array of citizens who will be encouraged to express their thoughts openly and honestly. The academy experience will conclude with an academy graduation.

The CPA will be each Wednesday from 2/8/17 to 4/19/17, 7pm-10pm at the Police Training Facility. There will be no class during spring break. Interested participants should live, work, or attend school in College Park, be at least 18 years old, successfully pass a criminal history, have no prior felony convictions and no misdemeanor convictions for offenses involving weapons or violence, and have no misdemeanor or felony arrests within 1 year prior to the Community Police Academy, and sign a Consent and Release liability waiver form.

Kaitlyn was scheduled to meet a friend at the Eppley Recreation Center at approximately 5 p.m. to go on a hiking trip. When Kaitlyn did not show up, her friend came to the police station to report her missing.

Here is what our investigation has revealed thus far:

On November 10, 2016, security footage showed Kaitlyn leaving Allegany Hall at approximately 4:42 p.m., with a camping style backpack and a pink bag.

On November 10, 2016, at approximately 4:34 p.m., a white taxi cab entered campus via South Gate.

On November 10, 2016, at approximately 4:44 p.m., Kaitlyn got into a white taxi cab in front of Annapolis Hall by herself and on her own accord.

Investigators located and interviewed the taxi cab driver. Kaitlyn was dropped off in front of a Marina in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Baltimore City.

UMPD investigators met with the Baltimore City Police Department investigators to review security footage from the Marina. Security footage indicated that just after being dropped off by the taxi cab, she appeared to get into another waiting vehicle (SUV) on her own accord and by herself.

A witness reported seeing Kaitlyn on a Charm City Circulator bus on November 11, 2016, at approximately 8:40 a.m. Investigators interviewed this witness and verified this sighting.

Investigators continue to follow up on investigative leads and tips.

We have no reason to suspect foul play in this case. Our team of investigators will continue to work on this case until we have located Kaitlyn and have verified that she is okay. Anyone with information on Kaitlyn's whereabouts is asked to call the University of Maryland Police Department at 301-405-3555.

The investigation concluded that the gun was a rubber rifle used for training and being carried by an ROTC member dressed in plain clothes. The rubber rifle did not pose a threat. UMPD is sharing the following information so the community can better understand the incident.

On October 6, 2016 at 1:58 p.m. University Police received a report of a possible armed subject near Ritchie Coliseum. Officers met with the students who reported seeing the individual and verified seeing the man with what they believed was an AR-15 rifle. Our Security Operations Center reviewed camera footage and observed the individual enter a vehicle and leave campus. Follow-up with ROTC on campus revealed that the individual was likely a member of their unit. Because we could not immediately locate and identify this individual, we elected to issue a UMD Alert. Once the information was verified, we issued a follow-up message informing the community that the situation was resolved. The weapon carried by the individual was a rubber rifle used for training. This type of weapon is incapable of being fired. The individual is a Non-Commissioned Officer with the Marine Corps assigned to the Naval ROTC program.

Chief Mitchell has met with members of the ROTC command staff to ensure this type of incident does not happen in the future.",2024-04-11T03:18:34.386343+00:00

To avoid becoming a victim of this extortion scheme, look for the following possible indicators:

Incoming calls come from an outside area code, sometimes from Puerto Rico with area codes (787), (939) and (856)

Calls do not come from the kidnapped victim’s phone

Callers go to great lengths to keep you on the phone

Callers prevent you from calling or locating the “kidnapped” victim

Ransom money is only accepted via wire transfer service

If you receive a phone call from someone who demands payment of a ransom for a kidnapped victim, the following should be considered:

Try to slow the situation down. Request to speak to the victim directly. Ask, “How do I know my loved one is okay?”

If they don’t let you speak to the victim, ask them to describe the victim or describe the vehicle they drive, if applicable.

Listen carefully to the voice of the kidnapped victim if they speak.

Attempt to call, text, or contact the victim via social media. Request that the victim call back from his or her cell phone.

While staying on the line with alleged kidnappers, try to call the alleged kidnap victim from another phone.

To buy time, repeat the caller’s request and tell them you are writing down the demand, or tell the caller you need time to get things moving.

Don’t directly challenge or argue with the caller. Keep your voice low and steady.

Request the kidnapped victim call back from his/her cell phone.

The 2015 Annual Safety and Security Report is available for your review.

Our report provides safety and security information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department.

In 2015, the Clery crime rate for the University remained consistently low, with some reporting differences of note. The reported number of sexual assaults increased from 2014, which is in part, related to the University’s awareness campaigns that encourages reporting and increases training on risk reduction and bystander intervention for sexual assault. The campus saw significant decreases in robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, and incidents of dating violence, to name a few. With the decriminalization of small amounts of Marijuana in the State of Maryland, drug referrals and arrests are at all-time lows.

The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which, by far, is the most commonly reported criminal offense on campus. Other property crimes reportable through Clery include Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson. The men and women of the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) are responsible for keeping the UMD campus safe and secure and in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department keeping the surrounding areas safe and secure. Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Walking escorts

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phone (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive detection K9 unit

Crime prevention programs

Criminal and traffic law enforcement, reporting, and investigation

Student Police Auxiliary

Safety Ambassadors

Emergency 911 center

In 2015, The University of Maryland announced the debut of UMD Guardian, a mobile campus safety application (app) available to all students, faculty and staff. The UMD Guardian app for Apple and Android smartphones is designed to allow users quick and easy contact with UMPD, and has additional features for increasing safety on campus. Using UMD Guardian, users can initiate a safety timer session; place a panic (emergency) call to UMPD; or text a tip to UMPD. See Pages 9-10 for more details on UMD Guardian and information on how to download and install the app.

As part of our evolving safety initiatives, in cooperation with the City of College Park, the City-University Partnership was awarded grant funds to implement a Safety Ambassador Pilot Program that began in Spring of 2016. The Program is designed to have safety ambassadors who patrol the city area with a focus on safety and hospitality – greeting visitors, giving directions, doing outreach to citizens in need, and serving as eyes and ears for the agency by reporting quality of life issues such as potholes, downed trees, outages, hazards and more; as well as reporting any suspicious activities they encounter.

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action. We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, but a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

During this exercise, a small portion of Stadium Drive will be blocked off between the north entrance of Stadium Drive Garage and parking lot Q. The service road that wraps around the stadium will also be blocked off to vehicles and pedestrians. There will be staff on site to help with alternative routes during the course of the exercise. Once the exercise has ended, the roadways will re-open.
###","On Friday, July 29, 2016, the Office of Emergency Management will conduct a training exercise at Maryland Stadium. The purpose of this training exercise is to safely evacuate fans out of the stadium and into nearby buildings/structures. As some may recall, on September 12, 2015, we encountered a weather emergency during a home football game. There was a storm heading our way that included lightning, which led to the evacuation of our football stadium. This was the first time in our history that we had to evacuate fans out from the stadium during a football game.

The training exercise is scheduled to begin at approximately 1:30 p.m. and will end at approximately 3:30 p.m., weather dependent.

Summary of Incident

On May 21, 2016 at 1:46 a.m., the University of Maryland Police Department, Emergency Communications Center received a 911 call, routed through Prince George’s County Public Safety Communications Center, regarding a fight at the 8500 block of Boteler Lane at The Courtyards Apartments.

Officers approached the apartment, and a female resident answered the door and explained that a graduation celebration was taking place. The officers advised the resident and partygoers, who were primarily African American, of the report of fighting inside the apartment and the possible use of a baseball bat. The residents refuted the claim, and initially resisted efforts of the officers to enter the premises.

The officers entered the apartment, and discovered there was no fight in progress. A decision was made to shut down the party, which exceeded the legal capacity of the apartment. Some of the partygoers left voluntarily, and others attempted to assist in clearing the crowd out. Others stayed in the apartment and in the breezeway area and did not disperse as instructed.

As partygoers were exiting the apartment, a group of individuals surrounded a UMPD officer on the breezeway and did not comply with instructions to disperse. Two officers deployed pepper spray to disperse the crowd. According to their statements, the officers used the spray because they believed the UMPD officer was in danger. The officers noted that one individual had to be restrained by a fellow partygoer. Two individuals were identified and arrested and charged with obstructing and hindering a police officer, disorderly conduct, and failing to obey a lawful order. Those charges have subsequently been dropped by the state.

The Prince George’s County Fire Department/EMS personnel arrived to help those who were affected by pepper spray. The area became overcrowded, and several individuals did not respond to instructions by UMPD officers to disperse. This delayed the EMS personnel’s efforts to help those who needed assistance.

EMS requested additional assistance with the growing crowd. Responding to the request, a UMPD officer witnessed another officer struggling with an individual who was being uncooperative. The responding officer deployed pepper spray and the struggle ended.

The officer who deployed the pepper spray arrested the individual who he believed to be the uncooperative person. While back at UMPD Headquarters, body worn camera footage revealed that the individual arrested was not the same person involved in the struggle. UMPD released the individual without charges a short time later.

UMPD policy requires an internal administrative review in all instances of pepper spray deployment. That internal review commenced May 22 and the final report was delivered to me on July 9. I want to thank Lieutenant Leadbeter for his thorough review of this incident.

Findings

The administrative review, led by Lieutenant Leadbeter, included 26 interviews and statements from UMPD officers, PGPD officers, EMS personnel, and partygoers, and careful review of all body cam video and other footage captured by partygoers.

The administrative review concluded that the deployments of pepper spray fell within UMPD use of force guidelines. However, the review concluded that the manner of deployment during the second spray did not meet UMPD standards. Even in instances when the deployment of pepper spray to disperse a crowd is considered reasonable, it still must be applied correctly.

A separate, criminal investigation determined the original 911 call to be a false call. The false call for a potential fight involving a weapon, made in retaliation because the individuals were denied entry to the party, bears significant responsibility for subsequent events. Therefore, UMPD has obtained a criminal summons against the individuals who made the false call.

Conclusions

While the administrative review focused on the deployment of the pepper spray, we are able to draw several additional lessons from the report and from the review of the body cam video.

As it is the responsibility of all UMPD police officers to protect and serve our community, we must exhibit exemplary judgement to deescalate difficult situations. Throughout the May 21 incident, we should have handled the situation with more diplomacy. It is my opinion that the subsequent deployment of pepper spray could have been avoided. This did not have to happen.

Furthermore, even in instances when the deployment of pepper spray is considered reasonable, it must be applied correctly. In the May 21 incident, the second deployment was determined to not meet our standards.

Our mission is to serve the university community, protect life and property, and to enforce the law. To be successful in that mission, we must be committed partners with all members of our community – and that includes holding our entire department to very high standards of conduct and accountability. For overall conduct unbecoming an officer, including the incorrect use of pepper spray in the second deployment, I have ordered a sanction of two weeks suspension without pay against one of our officers.

This incident has created distress and anguish among the students affected and within our broader community. UMPD is committed to equity and fairness in all of our interactions with our diverse community. We will continue to work diligently toward this end, and, therefore, I have ordered training in areas of implicit bias and diversity for every officer in the department.

Additionally, I have initiated a comprehensive review of our use of force guidelines, to ensure that every officer understands the protocol for appropriate and correct use of pepper spray. I will ask the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Judge Alexander Williams, Jr., Executive Director of UMD’s Williams Center for Education, Justice and Ethics, and other members of the campus community, including students, to assist us in this policy review.

We are addressing these issues because we recognize that the trust of our campus community—particularly our African-American community – is an integral part to our collective success.

Every day, UMPD officers come to work to serve and protect our community. We all wear the uniform proudly through situations both rewarding and challenging. We remain committed to the highest level of professional standards at all times. Together with our campus community, we will continue to uphold and strengthen our mission of service.

As our officers were searching the area for the suspect in this case, we received two additional reports of robbery.
At approximately 9:08 p.m., the first robbery occurred near Tydings Hall, on the McKeldin Mall side. A weapon was implied. The victim complied with the suspect’s demand and handed over his property to the suspect.
At approximately 10:12 p.m., the second robbery occurred near Queen Anne’s Hall. And at approximately 10:15 p.m., the third robbery occurred near Queen Anne’s Hall. A black handgun was seen in these two incidents and property was taken.
In total, we had three reports. There were four victims all together. Three of the four victims are UMD students.  None of the victims were injured. Our officers searched the area but were not able to locate the suspect.","On July 12, 2016, at approximately 9:20 p.m., UMPD received a call for a robbery that occurred outside, in front of Tydings Hall.

In total, we had three reports. There were four victims all together. Three of the four victims are UMD students. None of the victims were injured. Our officers searched the area but were not able to locate the suspect.

Our Criminal Investigation Unit is actively investigating these cases. What we know is that three of the victims were playing the Pokémon Go game. The fourth victim was not playing the game but had their phone out. Items that were stolen were cell phones. We have no reason to believe that there is more than one suspect involved in these cases. The suspect is described as a male wearing a black mask and dark clothing.

These are still active investigations and when additional information become available for release, we will distribute accordingly. Individuals with any information regarding these cases are encouraged to contact UMPD at 301-405-3555.

Safety tips :

Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you.

If you see suspicious activity or behavior, call police right away.

Avoid isolation. Take a friend when playing the game and stay in well-lit areas.

Trust your instincts. They are a natural gift that tells you when something is wrong.

Don’t play the game while driving.

Do not trespass onto private property.
