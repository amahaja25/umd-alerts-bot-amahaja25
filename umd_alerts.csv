                 Dear campus community,
The 2023 Annual Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.","Dear campus community,

The 2023 Annual Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

Printed copies of the ASR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-6399.

Printed copies of the AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

We hope you will read the reports carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

                 Dear Campus Community,","Dear Campus Community,



One of the things I look forward to with the start of the spring semester is sharing with you updates from the department and reminders on how to Be a Safe Terp. Since I wrote to you last spring, much has happened. With that being said, I share with you information about new initiatives, and updates on ongoing initiatives, safety resources, and upcoming community events. We know that the first few weeks of classes can be overwhelming, but know this, we are here for you.

For many of us, we are still grappling with a video depicting a horrific killing of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police officers. I condemn their criminal misconduct in the strongest possible words. As an officer of the law for more than 50 years, it sickens me too, and I grieve alongside our community.

I am grateful to Nyumburu, MICA and the Black Faculty Staff Association for holding an event yesterday where we could grieve together.

Much work is to be done across the country, but here in College Park, our commitment to working with all of you to be a department of excellence has never been stronger. We continue to work with our campus partners in Enhancing Safety and Community Policing at the University of Maryland. You can see the progress on the online dashboard.

As we returned to a normal on campus resident population back in the fall, which was a first since the start of the pandemic in 2020, we anticipated seeing an increase in the number of calls for service and incidents. As expected, we did see an increase. In 2022, we responded to 103,453 calls for service compared to 98,061 in 2021. As we finalized the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, Part-I crime statistics for 2022, I share with you that we had 228 Part-I crime reports which yielded a 33.33% increase in overall crime compared to 2021 (171 Part-I crime reports). The majority of this increase is due to property crimes such as theft, burglary, and motor vehicle theft.

New and Ongoing Initiatives

Transparency and communication are crucial in building and maintaining trust. One of the ways we exhibit this is by making our crime stats available on our website. For decades, our department has reported our crime stats to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, Summary Reporting System (SRS) - an aggregate monthly totals. In 2021, the FBI retired the SRS and transitioned to a National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) - a new national data collection standard. After months of planning and coordination between our Records and IT unit, we have made the switch to NIBRS reporting. This switch makes sure we are meeting federal data standards, improving operations, and better informing the public about the nature of crime in our community. We will continue to publish our crime stats monthly on our website. More information about the switch to NIBRS can be viewed here.

As the first police department in the State of Maryland to partner with Lights On! this past February, we are proud to be part of a community-driven program that offers vouchers for free, up to $250 worth of repairs, instead of traffic tickets. Since joining Lights On!, we have issued over 100 vouchers to motorists with light(s) out on their vehicle.

Working with our partners in the Division of Student Affairs, we are coming up with innovative solutions to address the needs of the community as it relates to mental health. As I shared last year, we have a Crisis Intervention Team. We now have 21 officers and 911 call takers trained specifically in the field of Crisis Intervention and are using de-escalation techniques that improve the safety for our community and the officers involved. We are continuing to provide this additional training to all of our officers and 911 call takers.

Another resource that is available not to just public safety but all members of our community is the The BETA (Behavior Evaluation and Threat Assessment) Team. The BETA Team, led by the Division of Student Affairs, has expertise from various functional areas across campus. They evaluate reports about University of Maryland community members who behave in a concerning manner. Early intervention is important. See something, say something, do something. We invite you to review their resources on how to assist those in distress. The University also offers Mental Health and First Aid Training. This 8-hour training gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem and help connect them to the appropriate care.

Other measures expand Move Over Law and allow 24-hour temporary registration","MDOT MVA Bills Focused on Child Safety and Extended Renewals Among Laws Taking Effect on October 1

Other measures expand Move Over Law and allow 24-hour temporary registration

GLEN BURNIE, MD (September 29, 2022) – The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration (MDOT MVA) is alerting customers of several new bills taking effect October 1, including two – Senate Bill 176 and Senate Bill 218 – that were introduced by MDOT MVA leadership, passed by the General Assembly and signed into law earlier this year by Governor Larry Hogan.

The first measure is designed to help protect infants and toddlers in the event of a crash while also providing caregivers with clear guidance on child passenger safety. Senate Bill 176 requires a child under age 2 being transported in a motor vehicle to be secured in a rear-facing child safety seat that complies with federal regulations until the child reaches the manufacturer’s weight or height limit for the child safety seat. More information and resources can be found through MDOT MVA’s Highway Safety Office here.

The second measure, Senate Bill 218, allows MDOT MVA to issue a temporary renewal for qualified individuals for up to two years for driver’s licenses and identification (ID) cards. The bill was introduced by MDOT MVA as a result of lessons learned during COVID-19.

Prior to enactment of Senate Bill 218, MDOT MVA could only extend driver’s licenses and ID cards for 90 days, which was not sufficient under certain circumstances, for instance active-duty military members, students studying outside the state, and those who are at risk during state of emergency. Increasing the temporary renewal period gives customers more flexibility when they are unable to visit a branch office.

“MDOT MVA is not only committed to improving our customer’s experience when conducting agency business, but also to providing education to prevent motor vehicle injuries and fatalities,” said MDOT MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer, who also serves as Governor Larry Hogan’s Highway Safety Representative. “Our team did a tremendous job turning challenges presented during the pandemic into opportunities for the agency to implement customer-oriented changes and ensuring our most vulnerable road users are receiving the utmost protection while traveling.”

Another key measure taking effect October 1 is Senate Bill 147, which expands Maryland’s Move Over Law. The revision requires drivers to move over or slow down when approaching any vehicle that is stopped or parked and displaying hazard warning lights, road flares or other caution signals. Previously, the “move over or slow down” provision applied only when approaching law enforcement vehicles, tow trucks and emergency response vehicles and equipment.

Another new law is the result of House Bill 222, and requires the driver of a vehicle traveling slower than the general speed of traffic on an interstate highway in a rural area to drive the vehicle in the right-hand lanes. The law also mandates that MDOT MVA include information about this requirement in the state’s driver education curriculum.

Several other bills taking effect October 1 have an impact on MDOT MVA’s processes. House Bill 1076 allows MDOT MVA to issue an electronic 24-hour registration to the new owner of a vehicle to allow transport of the vehicle home after purchase. House Bill 368 requires MDOT MVA to allow a 10-day grace period for a customer to return or provide paperwork for registration tags to be returned before issuing a penalty for lapse of insurance following cancellation of a vehicle’s policy.

Other bills going into effect on October 1 related to motor vehicle operations include:

HB 0157 : Vehicle Laws – Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicles – Reserved Parking Spaces prohibits anyone from stopping, standing or parking a vehicle in a parking space designated for plug-in electric drive vehicles.

prohibits anyone from stopping, standing or parking a vehicle in a parking space designated for plug-in electric drive vehicles. HB 0679 : Vehicle Laws – Licensing of Businesses and Occupations – Definition of Vehicle Salesman requires anybody who negotiates with a person to enter into a financial security or warranty agreement on behalf of a dealer to obtain a salesman license.

requires anybody who negotiates with a person to enter into a financial security or warranty agreement on behalf of a dealer to obtain a salesman license. HB 1150: Vehicle Equipment – Highway Maintenance and Service – Green Flashing Lights allows certain highway maintenance and service equipment and vehicles, while in use for snow removal or the protection of highway maintenance workers, to be equipped display green flashing lights simultaneously with yellow or amber flashing lights. The change eliminates a restriction of these types of lights that previously existed.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

Printed copies of the ASR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-6399.

Printed copies of the AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

We hope you will read the reports carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

At approximately 9:16 a.m., a male (unaffiliated) walked into the Pocomoke Building (UMPD Police Station) with an old military artillery shell. An officer took the shell and placed it outside of the Pocomoke Building and the building was evacuated as a precaution.

The Prince George’s County Fire Department, Bomb Squad was notified to respond for further evaluation of the shell. Baltimore Avenue between Rossborough Lane and College Avenue was closed to traffic and pedestrians were directed to go around the building. PGFD Bomb Squad arrived, and it was determined to close off more roadways and evacuate buildings nearby the Pocomoke Building as a preauction. After further investigation, it was determined that the shell was safe and not a threat. The roadways were reopened, and officers cleared the scene.

As we finalized the Uniform Crime Report, Part-I crime statistics for 2021, I share with you that overall crime fell to 4.47%, with a 4% decrease in property crimes.

New and Ongoing Initiatives

We are excited to announce our partnership with Lights On! This is a community-driven program that offers repair vouchers instead of traffic tickets for participating law enforcement agencies and communities they serve. Officers can provide drivers with vouchers redeemable for free repairs of broken lights at University Gas 2 Go, located at 8153 Baltimore Avenue, College Park, MD.

Safety and security are a community effort. One way we can achieve this goal is through Be Smart. Be Safe. This coordinated effort is a situational awareness safety campaign that emphasizes how Terps can be safe. When coupled with See Something, Say Something, we are reminded that we all play an active role in safety at Maryland.

A new program for the department is our Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). Currently, we have 12 officers who are trained specifically in the field of Crisis Intervention and are able to interact with crisis situations using de-escalation techniques that improve the safety for our community and the officers involved. This program offers many benefits to public safety, the University’s Mental and Behavioral health services, the UMD community, and the families of the UMD community.

All UMPD officers receive training pertaining to individuals in crisis. However, our Crisis Intervention Officers received additional training in the areas of:

• Understanding signs and symptoms of mental illnesses and co-occurring disorders

• Recognizing when those signs and symptoms represent a crisis situation

• Safely de-escalating individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis

• Utilizing community resources and diversion strategies that are available to provide emergency assistance

This past fall, we successfully continued our accreditation efforts from The Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA®) and were reaccredited. A voluntary process, CALEA is an independent organization that reviews our policies and procedures and ensures we are in compliance with their standards. Since November 23, 1996, we have been accredited, and we are proud to have maintained The Gold Standard in Public Safety for 25 years!

I encourage our community to take advantage of other services and resources available, including the UMD Guardian App.

University’s Comfort Dog

Teddy the Terp is ecstatic that our community is back for the spring semester. While Teddy is still going through his training to become a certified comfort dog, members of our community can make a request for Teddy to attend any upcoming meetings, events, or even a one on one session. Just email Teddy at teddytheterp@umpd.umd.edu and his handler, Officer Melissa Fischer will respond for scheduling. You can follow Teddy on Instagram at @teddytheterp.

Our Service K-9s

After nearly 10 years of service to the University of Maryland and surrounding communities, our Explosives Detection K-9s, Jimbo, Bracken, and Pink have retired. The fourth dog, K-9 Chief, would have been retiring with them, but sadly passed away after his battle with cancer in 2019. Some of their biggest accomplishments include protecting Terp fans during nine seasons of Maryland Football and Basketball games. Additionally, the dogs would patrol the University of Maryland campus daily, working to keep our facilities and our students, faculty, staff and guests safe. We wish them happiness in their next stages in life as civilian pets with their handlers and their family.

The retirement of three dogs can only mean one thing. Please welcome our three newest members, K-9s Hera, Hercules, and Buzz, to the University of Maryland community. You can expect to see them around campus, conducting trainings and assisting at special events and more. Unlike Teddy, these are working dogs, so we ask that you save your belly rubs for Teddy. But, please engage with the dogs’ handlers; they love talking with members of our community about their partner and how they help keep us safe from evolving threats.

Student Job Opportunities

Come be part of the tradition of Terps Protecting Terps! Students can work as Student Police Aides in our Student Police Auxiliary or Monitors in our Security Operations Center. All majors are welcomed for both positions.

In Conclusion

Since 1975, we have been here serving our community. Answering the call time and time again. We are here for you 24/7/365, and always will be. Protecting Maryland’s Future.

BRIEF DETAILS:

We write to you this evening to make you aware of multiple incidents of fraud (scams) that have been reported in our area.

Since September, we have received five reports of fraud with the most recent incident reported to the University of Maryland Police Department on October 14, 2021. The victims in these cases are University affiliated.

Below is a summary of the incidents that were reported to police:

One victim received a phone call from an individual claiming to be from a foreign government entity who had a warrant for their arrest.

The other four victims were defrauded over various social media apps. In one instance an individual claimed to be an investor who made false guarantees of financial gain. In the remaining three incidents, each victim engaged in a consensual conversation with an unknown individual on-line. The individual then threatened to release photos of the victim if they didn’t pay the individual.



In all of these incidents, a scammer made false accusations paired with fear tactics to convince the victim to buy gift cards and/or send US currency as payment in order to avoid any further action taken against them.

The University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Criminal Investigations Unit are investigating these incidents.

Individuals with any information regarding these incidents are encouraged to contact police at 301-405-3555. Individuals wishing to remain anonymous may email http://www.umpd.umd.edu/contact/anonymous_tip.cfm .

When available for release, additional information, may be obtained by accessing the ""UMD Safety Notice"" portion of our web site: http://universityofmarylandpolice.com/stats/safety_notices.cfm and http://umpdnews.umd.edu/home

It is important to remember the following tips:

Scammers pretend to be from an organization you know. Such as the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Medicare, police, etc.

Scammers always say there is a problem. They might say you’re in trouble with the government, you owe money, you have a warrant, or a problem with your bank account.

Scammers pressure you to act immediately. They want you to act before you think. They will tell you not to hang up the phone, threaten to arrest you, deport you, or threaten to hack your information. Just to name a few.

Scammers will tell you to pay in a specific way. They often tell people to send money through a money transfer company or purchase gift cards and have you read the back of the gift card number to them, or they will tell you that they will send you a check (that will later turn out to be fake), tell you to deposit it and then send them the money.

If you believe you are a victim of a scam, contact UMPD to file a report at 301-405-3555. You may also file a report with the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint, or call 877-382-4357.

Safety Tips:

Don’t give out Personal Identifying Information (PII), such as Social Security Number or government issued photo to scammers. They can use this information to steal your identity and open accounts in your name.

Don’t send photos of yourself to scammers. They will use the photo and release it to people you know and on-line.

Gift cards are for gifts, NOT payments.

The IRS will never call to demand payment, such as prepaid debt cards, gift cards, wire transfer or bitcoin. Neither will Law Enforcement/Immigration. Generally, the IRS will first mail you a bill if you owe taxes.

The 2021 Annual Safety and Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies.

This report also reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

During 2020, the University of Maryland Community faced numerous challenges. Despite these challenges, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) continued to work on-campus 24/7, 7 days a week to serve and protect the university, ensuring campus safety was UMPD’s priority during a global pandemic. Throughout 2020, UMPD responded to over 94,000 calls for service; these include but are not limited to: responding to emergency and non-emergency calls, initiating traffic stops, conducting building checks across our campus community, responding to vehicle and building lockouts, investigating traffic accidents and providing walking escorts.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Emergency 911 Center

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Criminal Investigations Unit

Information Analysis Unit

Student Police Auxiliary

Building Security Services (BSS)

Below is the warning from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that was published on March 30, 2021.

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today warned of an ongoing IRS-impersonation scam that appears to primarily target educational institutions, including students and staff who have "".edu"" email addresses.

The IRS' phishing@irs.gov has received complaints about the impersonation scam in recent weeks from people with email addresses ending in "".edu."" The phishing emails appear to target university and college students from both public and private, profit and non-profit institutions.

Taxpayers who believe they have a pending refund can easily check on its status at Where's My Refund? on IRS.gov.

The suspect emails display the IRS logo and use various subject lines such as ""Tax Refund Payment"" or ""Recalculation of your tax refund payment."" It asks people to click a link and submit a form to claim their refund.

The phishing website requests taxpayers provide their:

Social Security number

First Name

Last Name

Date of Birth

Prior Year Annual Gross Income (AGI)

Driver's License Number

Current Address

City

State/U.S. Territory

ZIP Code/Postal Code

Electronic Filing PIN

People who receive this scam email should not click on the link in the email, but they can report it to the IRS. For security reasons, save the email using ""save as"" and then send that attachment to phishing@irs.gov or forward the email as an attachment to phishing@irs.gov. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) and IRS Criminal Investigation have been notified.

Taxpayers who believe they may have provided identity thieves with this information should consider immediately obtaining an Identity Protection PIN. This is a voluntary opt-in program. An IP PIN is a six-digit number that helps prevent identity thieves from filing fraudulent tax returns in the victim's name.

Taxpayers who attempt to e-file their tax return and find it rejected because a return with their SSN already has been filed should file a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit PDF, to report themselves as a possible identity theft victim.

COVID-19 Testing Spring Requirements","What Terps Need to Know

From the University of Maryland, Division of Student Affairs

Community Expectations

COVID-19 Testing Spring Requirements

All students, faculty, and staff must attest to a COVID-19 test result before returning to campus.

Residence hall students are required to complete pre and post-arrival testing. They must attest negative COVID-19 test results within 10 days before move-in and no later than two weeks after on-campus arrival on Keep Terps Safe portal to enable building access.

Students living on or near campus will be required to be tested every two weeks in the spring semester.

Symptom Monitoring

Those returning to campus must continue to complete daily symptom monitoring on the UMD app or the Keep Terps Safe Portal (return.umd.edu). This is one of our key mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Face Coverings

As of January 16, 2021, Prince George’s County will require face coverings to be worn in all public places, outdoors or indoors, even where you are able to maintain 6 feet of distance from others. This means that in all locations on campus and the surrounding community, except for your private residence, a face covering must be worn at all times. Face coverings are not required during vigorous exercise outdoors.



Self-isolation/Quarantine for students returning to College Park

For the first two weeks of the semester, all courses will be online. Students are asked to sequester and limit in-person gatherings for two weeks after arrival to help mitigate the spread of the virus. All activities, events and programs will remain virtual during that time as we want to wait for students to be tested on campus before we begin to offer in person opportunities for engagement.

Spring Quarantine & Isolation Housing

Consistent with last semester, residential students who test positive or have been exposed to a close contact who has tested positive will need to move to quarantine and isolation housing in Leonardtown or on Fraternity Row. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has offered new quarantine guidelines. Students in quarantine or isolation will now be required to stay ten days, whether they are being quarantined for possible exposure or isolated with symptoms or a positive test result.

For Students Living in Residence Halls

New to housing residents move-in information

New-to-housing students are invited to move-in in advance of returning students on Thursday, January 21, and Friday, January 22, by appointment only. We encourage new students to return on one of these two days to settle in and participate in the Winter Welcome events. Move-in appointments are available through February 8.

Residents may log in to their Housing Portal for assignment and move-in scheduling details.

Returning residents move-in information

Residence Hall move-in for returning residents begins January 23 by appointment only. Appointments will extend through 2/8 for residents who wish to delay return.

Move-in appointment and pre-arrival negative COVID-19 test result activate the student ID to access the residence hall. If a residence hall student comes back early without an appointment, access will not work.

Returning residents should plan to complete a curbside drop off to alleviate congestion in the building and support the 4Maryland healthy behaviors.

Programs and Engagement Activities

Students are expected to limit their in-person interactions for the first two weeks of the spring semester and take another COVID-19 test before in-person instruction commences. These measures were implemented at the beginning of the fall semester and helped begin the academic year with as few positive cases as possible.

Students can have socially distanced conversations using face coverings in shared spaces on their assigned floor.

Students should wear face coverings outdoors and in public spaces and should not go to bars or restaurants, and they should not host or attend large gatherings and parties.

All programs, events, and activities will be held virtually in the first two weeks of the semester. We want to wait for students to be tested on campus before offering in-person opportunities for engagement.

For Students Living Off-Campus

Many virtual programs are scheduled, and all students are invited to attend. There will be no in-person programs and events during the first two weeks of the semester.

Essential on-campus services will be available for off-campus students.

Off-campus students are expected to follow similar guidelines as students living on campus. Students can leave their living quarters to exercise, buy groceries, or take care of essential functions only —as was done during the stay-at-home order.

There can be no social events, gatherings, or parties on or off-campus during this time.

Students should wear face coverings outdoors and in public spaces and should not go to bars or restaurants, and should not host or attend large gatherings and parties.

Engagement Opportunities

Weeks 1 & 2

All programs, events, and activities will be held virtually in the first two weeks of the semester.

Weeks 3 & 4

Limited in-person on-campus programming or events may be offered dependent upon PG County and public health guidance.

Dear Campus Community,

I am sorry that my first email to you is that of sorrow. The Greenbelt Police Department has lost one of their own. Cpl. Christine Peters was critically injured while investigating a vehicle crash on Edmonston Road near Sunnyside Road on January 2, 2021. While Cpl. Peters was on foot, she was struck by a passing vehicle.

On January 14, 2021, Cpl. Peters passed away due to the injuries she sustained while on duty on January 2, 2021.

Cpl. Peters began her law enforcement career right here at the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) in 1994 as a graduate of UMPD Police Academy, Session 12. Cpl. Peters served the University of Maryland community from 1994 to 1998 and continued her law enforcement career at the Greenbelt Police Department.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Cpl. Peters’ family, friends, the Greenbelt Police Department and the Greenbelt Community as we mourn with you over the loss of Cpl. Peters.

Tomorrow, the funeral procession of Cpl. Peters will take place, with it beginning on campus and ending at the City of Greenbelt. If you are on campus and you see a large number of police vehicles in the parking lot 1C area, they are here for the funeral procession. The escort will enter campus at North Gate (by the Iribe Building) and travel up Campus Drive to parking lot 1C.

The procession will begin at approximately 1 p.m., on Friday, January 22, 2021. The procession will depart from parking lot 1C and travel east on Campus Drive, right onto Regents Drive, left onto Baltimore Avenue, right onto Campus Drive and proceed to the City of Greenbelt via Kenilworth Avenue to Greenbelt Road.

Those of you who wish to pay your respects to Cpl. Peters, you may do so at any point along the route. If on campus, some options to view the procession are the steps of the Memorial Chapel facing Regents Drive, the sidewalk along Campus Drive between H.J. Patterson and Edward St. John, and the sidewalk along Regents Drive between McKeldin Mall and the Administration Building.

If traveling on campus before and at the time of the funeral procession, please expect traffic delays. This include delays in campus transportation as portions of roadways will be temporarily shut down as the procession enters and leaves campus.

Please keep the family of Corporal Christine Peters in your thoughts and prayers.

The decedent was located in a parking lot suffering from gunshot wounds. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

The 2020 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review.

The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies.

This report also reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

The University of Maryland Police Department is responsible for keeping the University of Maryland, College Park campus safe and secure. We do this in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department, working together to keep the surrounding areas safe and secure.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Emergency 911 Center

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

Criminal Investigations Unit

Information Analysis Unit

Student Police Auxiliary

Building Security Services (BSS)

Crime prevention programs

Safe Terp Trade Zone (On-line Purchase Exchange Area)

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phones (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System (UMD Alerts)

UMD Guardian Safety App

ShotSpotter

AccuWeather

The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the ASR will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

To view the ASR, please visit:

http://www.umpd.umd.edu/stats/AnnualSecurityReport.pdf

Printed copies of the ASR may be obtained from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3555.

To view the Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR), please visit: http://www.essr.umd.edu/fire/report/. The purpose of this report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. Individual printed copies of the 2020 AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

As you review the resources listed in the ASR, please keep in mind that due to COVID-19, hours of operations may have changed for some departments. Please check each department’s website for the latest information.

We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, and a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

BRIEF DETAILS:

We write to you today to make you aware of multiple incidents of fraud (scams) that have been reported in our area.

Over the past two weeks, we have received four reports of fraud (scams). The victims in these cases are University Affiliated and were either contacted by email or by phone. In each case, the caller was pretending to be from a Government Agency, an Employer, an Electronic Company, and Law Enforcement/Immigration. The scammers made false accusations paired with fear tactics to convince the victims to buy gift cards and/or bitcoins as payment in order to avoid any further action taken against them.

Scammers will use different methods to contact a potential victim. The scammer may call, email, text message or even approach the potential victim in person. The goal of the scammer is to make up false accusations along with fear tactics or even pity to try to convince the potential victim to comply with the scammer’s demands. The scammer will often remain on the phone with the victim until they receive the gift card number and pin. Once they have that information, there is little chance a victim could get their money back.

However, there could be a chance that you could recover your money back by calling the company immediately after a scammer is paid. To learn more, click here. But remember, gift cards are for gifts (birthdays, holidays, etc.), not payments. Anyone who demands payment by gift card is a scammer. Scammers will also sometimes use multiple numbers and multiple people to contact victims to legitimize their fraudulent claims.

Here are some examples of various scams:

If someone you don’t know mails you a check or approaches you in person and asks you to cash a check for them — don’t. It’s a scam.

If someone you don’t know asks you to cash a check and use a wire transfer service to send the money back to them after cashing the check for them — don’t. It’s a scam.

You receive a call or email from a scammer claiming to be from a government agency (federal, state, or local) and you need to make a payment in order to avoid being jailed, deported, fined, or that you owe taxes — don't it's a scam.

You receive a call or email form a scammer that a family member is in need of help or has been kidnapped and demands gift cards in the form of payment — don’t. It’s a scam.

You receive a call or email from tech-support and they demand gift cards in the form of payment — don’t. It’s a scam.

If you receive an e-mail/text message from a known individual asking you to send them money, verify with that person first before sending them money. It could be a scam.

If you believe you are a victim of a scam, contact UMPD to file a report at 301-405-3555. You may also file a report with the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint, or call toll-free: 1-877-FTC-HELP.

Below are some resources and videos from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Please take a moment to review this helpful information and learn how you can STOP scams in their tracks!

Safety Tips:

Don’t not give out Personal Identifying Information (PII), such as Social Security Number, government issued photo or selfies to scammers. They can use this information to steal your identity and open accounts in your name. Never provide PII to someone you don’t know.

Gift cards are for gifts, NOT payments.

payments. The IRS will never call to demand payment, such as prepaid debt cards, gift cards, wire transfer or bitcoin. Neither will Law Enforcement/Immigration. The IRS will first contact you via the mail with a bill to any taxpayer that owes taxes.

If you find yourself on the phone with a scammer, hang up. If you received an email, don’t respond. Report the email as spam.

As you know, we are a bustling campus with many modes of transportation. Over the years and in partnership with the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) and our own Department of Transportation Services (DOTS), there have been many new measures implemented that have improved the safety of all those in our campus community.

And as a reminder, when you are traveling on and around campus you should Walk Smart, Bike Smart, Drive Smart and Scoot Smart.

Tips for Drivers:

Stay alert and give driving your full attention

Show courtesy to other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists

Comply with traffic laws and heed all traffic signs, signals and markings

Tips for pedestrians, cyclists and scooters:

Wear a helmet when operating a bicycle or an e-scooter

Keep your eyes up - put your phone away

Wear clothing that is light and reflective after dark

DOTS has a wealth of transportation safety information on their website, to include, but not limited to, campus bike guidelines. Please be sure to check it out.

It is particularly important that we, as a community understand the role we each play in keeping ourselves and those around us safe. We are committed to keeping our roadways safe though educational outreach and traffic enforcement, but we need your help. When everyone is doing their part, then together we can all make traveling around campus safe - no matter your mode of transportation.

				Aaron Nysus in Custody Again for New Charge of Burglary for Breaking into College Park Residence


					 






								



								Aaron Nysus




					 

					 

					The Prince Geor","Aaron Nysus

The Prince George’s County Police Department has once again arrested the man who broke into at least seven residences in College Park since November 16th. In at least five of the cases, he’s facing peeping tom charges. He’s 37-year-old Aaron Nysus of the 3400 block of Notre Dame Street in Hyattsville. Detectives took him into custody again this morning. He is facing a new charge of first-degree burglary. The PGPD had arrested him last Friday on five previous charges but he posted bail and was released from the Department of Corrections the same day.

Nysus is now charged in connection with a break in on November 16th at a residence in the 4600 block of College Avenue. In that case, one victim awoke to Nysus in the home, which is a sorority house. Nysus fled moments after the victim woke up. Detectives have since spoken to a second victim in that home who advised a personal item was taken during the break-in.

In the other incidents, PGPD officers were called to an apartment building in the 4300 block of Hartwick Road on December 8th. They spoke to a victim who told officers that at 5:45 am, she awoke to the sound of her front door opening. She went to investigate the noise but didn’t find anyone in her apartment. Detectives reviewed surveillance video from the building and saw that Nysus was the suspect who broke into her apartment. He also was seen on surveillance video checking the doors of approximately 25 apartments that same morning. He walked into three other apartments while inside of the building. He stayed in each of those apartments for several minutes. In each of those cases, residents were inside and unaware of his presence.

Through various investigative techniques, detectives identified Nysus and obtained an arrest warrant which was executed on December 13th. During the search of his home, items of evidence were also recovered linking him to a break-in in an apartment on November 17th in the 4000 block of Knox Road. In that case, the victim woke up to Nysus standing by her bed. He then ran from her apartment.

Nysus is now charged with first-degree burglary and five counts of trespassing/peeping tom and fourth degree burglary.

Please call detectives if you have information on Nysus or are concerned you’ve been victimized by Nysus. They can be reached at 301-699-2601.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,other,info not available

Preliminarily, detectives believe the suspects targeted the victims because, at least, one of the victims is involved with the illegal sale of marijuana.

On November 11th, at approximately 7:15 pm, three suspects broke into the home in the 7400 block of Dickinson Avenue. At least two of the suspects had guns. The suspects demanded cash from the residents. Once they got the money, the suspects fled the home. No one was hurt.

The previous residential robbery occurred on October 30th on the same street, in the 7500 block of Dickinson Avenue at 10:40 pm. Preliminarily, detectives believe the house was targeted by two unknown suspects because, at least, one of the victims was involved in the illegal sale of marijuana.

“We wanted to address our community because we know there is concern, but we want to reiterate that these are not random crimes at all. So far the investigation has revealed the robberies, in both cases, surround individuals who are engaged in the illegal sale of marijuana and were targeted as a result of those criminal pursuits and activities,” said Chief Hank Stawinski.

At this time, there is no link between the victims in either case, however, detectives are working to determine whether the same suspects are responsible for both crimes.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,robbery,info not available

The 2019 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review. 
The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report.
In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where University students stay while on University-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated.","Working Together for a Safe Campus

The 2019 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review.

The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report.

In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where University students stay while on University-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated.

The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which is the most commonly reported criminal offense on campus. Other property crimes reportable through Clery include Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson.

The men and women of University of Maryland Police Department are responsible for keeping the University of Maryland, College Park campus safe and secure. We do this in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department, working together to keep the surrounding areas safe and secure.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Emergency 911 Center

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

UMD Guardian Safety App

AccuWeather

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

At approximately 1:10 p.m., the buildings were reopened to resume daily operations. The male was released without charges.

I want to share with you how your police department continues to keep campus safe and how you can play a role in your safety and in the safety of your fellow Terps.
Our officers continue to be proactive and responsive in their duties while serving and protecting our campus community. In 2018, we responded to over 75,000 calls for service, which include but are not limited to responding to calls, initiating traffic stops, conducting building checks across our campus community, responding to vehicle and building lockouts, investigating traffic accidents, and walking escorts.
We continue to see a decrease in crime on our campus, with the crime rate falling almost 38 percent in 2018. This is in addition to an almost 7 percent drop in crime the year before. This includes an almost 42 percent drop in theft, our most reported crime on campus. Burglary incidents continue to decrease over the ten-year span, with 11 reports made last year. Though there has been a decrease in reported crimes, we still need your help. Here are a few things you can do:","Dear Campus Community,

This includes an almost 42 percent drop in theft, our most reported crime on campus. Burglary incidents continue to decrease over the ten-year span, with 11 reports made last year. Though there has been a decrease in reported crimes, we still need your help. Here are a few things you can do:

Do not let others into your residential building or onto floors, stairwells, elevators, etc. unless you know them as residents of your building.

Keep your room door locked, when you’re asleep, down the hall, in the bathroom, or visiting others in your building.

Don’t leave your property unattended.

If storing items inside a locker temporarily, use a lock to secure the locker.

If you have a bicycle on campus, use a “U” type of lock and not a cable/chain lock to secure your property.

To see the crime trend for the past ten years and the decreasing trend of crime on our campus, click here.

The safety of our community is a community effort. All members of the University of Maryland community play a role in keeping campus safe. Recently, a female student alerted UMPD of an intruder that was entering rooms inside Hagerstown Hall in the middle of the night. Thanks to the quick reporting by our student, our officers were able to apprehend the intruder and charge him accordingly.

If you see something, say something to police immediately. Do not wait; the sooner you report, the sooner our officers can respond and address the situation.

As part of our ongoing commitment to your safety, and our continuous efforts to educate you on emergency preparedness, we encourage you to review our latest safety video, Responding to an Active Shooter. While there’s no reason to expect to face an active shooter situation while you’re here, being prepared and understanding widely accepted practices are the best ways to be safe.

You can call UMPD or text us from the UMD Guardian Safety App, which is available free in the app store. This is the only way you can text UMPD . This app also serves as a virtual walking escort service, automatically contacting UMPD if you do not arrive at your expected destination.

As always, we ask that you register your cell phone with UMD Alerts by visiting https://www.alert.umd.edu/ . You will receive text messages from UMPD in the event of an active emergency.

Working together we can achieve a common goal: a safe campus.

Go Terps!

Special Love is a nonprofit organization that provides cancer families a community of support, made up of other patients and families who know and understand the trials and triumphs of the cancer experience.

Special Love strives to bring together children with cancer and their families for fellowship, friendship, and fun. Families on the pediatric cancer journey have an ally during and after the cancer experience. Each family member is included in programs: Family weekends give mom and dad a chance to share with other adults, and siblings have a program that gives them the attention they need and an opportunity to make their own friends.

Hospitals refer the families of children with cancer to Special Love. The communication among the patient, doctors, family, and Special Love staff assures the best interests of the child with cancer are well-represented and everyone has an understanding of the patient’s needs.

Traditionally, No Shave November is known as a men’s only event. However, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) wants all of their employees to have an opportunity to participate.

That is why all members of the police department will have the option to either grow their beards out or paint their fingernails in extreme or unnatural colors.

So, if you see any of our police officers, staff or student police auxiliary members with bright color fingernail polish or more facial hair than usual, it’s because they are raising cancer awareness.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,other,info not available

This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Rates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows year after year that the majority of misused and abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including someone else’s medication being stolen from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are now advised that their usual methods for disposing of unused medicines—flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash—both pose potential safety and health hazards.

The 2018 Annual Safety and Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report are available for your review.

The Annual Security Report (ASR) provides safety and security information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where University students stay while on University-sponsored travel, traveling within the United States or abroad, area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments that report data back to our Police Department.

As you look over the statistics for 2017, you will see there are two murders reported. The first was the murder of 2nd Lt. Richard Collins, III, in which an arrest was made shortly thereafter. The accused is charged with murder and a hate crime and is expected to go to trial in January 2019.

The second murder occurred while a University of Maryland (UMD) student was traveling as part of a University-sponsored trip out-of-state. In the summer of 2018, in response to a Clery Act travel inquiry, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) was notified of a murder that occurred in the common area of a hotel in Chapel Hill, NC in February 2017. The student was staying in the hotel at the time of the murder. Clery Act regulations require that this crime is included in our statistics, as it occurred in a Non-Campus Property/Building for 2017. The student was not a victim, nor suspect in the incident.

There are a number of statistics worthy of mention. Burglary/B&E and Motor Vehicle Theft numbers have continued to decline to historic lows. The primary reasons for these results include the restructure of patrol service and camera surveillance enhancements. Furthermore, drug referrals and arrests remain at all-time lows due to the decriminalization in 2015 of small amounts of Marijuana in the State of Maryland. The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which, by far, is the most commonly, reported criminal offense on campus.

This report reflects changes in data sets due to revised reporting requirements and the development of new ways to report. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

The men and women of UMPD are responsible for keeping the UMD College Park campus safe and secure. We do this in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department, working together to keep the surrounding areas safe and secure.

Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Walking escorts

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phone (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System (UMD Alerts)

UMD Guardian Safety App

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive Detection K9 unit

In 2017 we created Safe Terp Trade Zone. Safe Terp Trade Zone is a safety resource that provides the buyer and seller a safe space to meet in person to complete their on-line purchase. Both parties can meet in the lobby of our police station or at our parking lot to conduct the exchange. More information about this program, visit https://umpdnews.umd.edu/node/934

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

One of the victims attempted to defend the group, but was struck in the head with the suspect's handgun. The suspect then stole property and left the house.

The incident was a targeted crime that was not reported for more than 24 hours after the incident occurred.

Mobile Devices around National Capital Region to Receive Test Alert Thursday Government Agencies Conducting Wireless Emergency Alerts Test This Week

REISTERSTOWN, Md. (April 2, 2018) — People who will be in or near the National Capital Region on Thursday, April 5, between 10-11 a.m. will be part of a regional Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) System test. Cell phones or other mobile devices in the area will receive the following message: “A test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts System. No action required.” WEA triggers a loud noise and text message on cell phones and enabled mobile devices.

Twenty jurisdictions will simultaneously issue a test message to the public through the WEA system. Local jurisdictions participating include: City of Alexandria, City of Bowie, City of College Park, City of Fairfax, City of Falls Church, City of Gaithersburg, City of Greenbelt, City of Takoma Park, City of Manassas, City of Manassas Park, City of Rockville, District of Columbia, Arlington County, Charles County, Fairfax County, Frederick County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, and Prince William County.

“Testing these notification systems is an important part of our preparedness system,” said Governor Larry Hogan. “During an imminent weather emergency or other serious threat, these alerts will save lives.”

During this test, it is possible that individuals may receive more than one alert message. Those who travel from one jurisdiction to another may hear messages from each jurisdiction. Also, people who live or travel in areas near the jurisdictions listed above may also receive the message because this technology uses cellular carrier towers.

Periodic testing of public alert and warning systems help assess the operational readiness of the system and identify any improvements. Public safety officials need to be sure that in times of an emergency or disaster, they have reliable methods and systems that will deliver urgent alerts and warnings to the public. Conducting a regional test supports the continued use, training, and improvement of the WEA system.

“Drills like these help us to ensure that our systems allow emergency managers to quickly communicate with you,” said Russ Strickland, executive director of MEMA. “During an incident, it is important to listen to messages and information from federal, state, and local officials and communicate any protective actions with your family, friends, and neighbors.”

Since its launch in 2012, the WEA system has been used more than 33,000 times nationwide to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical situations. Additional information on WEA is located at: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-emergency-alerts-wea.

We have more than 400 cameras in our community that are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including the addition of approximately 20 cameras in 2017.

This year, the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) completed Fair and Impartial Policing training for all sworn officers. We have offered a reward for information leading to the identification of the individual(s) responsible for recent hate bias incidents at Ellicott Dining Hall, and we continue to encourage the community to contact us when witnessing incidents of hate in our community. We also launched Safe Terp Trade Zone, a safe space for buyers and sellers to complete online transactions in person at our Police Station.

I encourage you to download the UMD Guardian Safety App if you have not already done so. This can serve as a virtual walking escort service, automatically contacting UMPD if you do not arrive at your expected destination. In addition to DOTS Nite Ride, we offer a 24/hour walking escort service upon request for on or around campus by calling 301-405-3555.

In recent years, we added an Explosives Detection K9 unit, an Information Analysis Unit for online investigative support, gunshot location detection technology, and Automated License Plate Readers. We also expanded our concurrent jurisdiction into the surrounding community to better serve and protect the University community and surrounding areas. As always, we ask that you register your cell phone with UMD alerts by visiting https://www.alert.umd.edu/

As a university, we continuously invest in enhanced safety measures, and we want each of you to be aware of the many resources working to keep our community safe.

Printed copies of the Annual Safety and Security Report may be obtained from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 (301) 405-3555 upon request.

To view the Annual Fire Safety Report, please visit: http://www.essr.umd.edu/fire/report/. The purpose of this report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. Individual printed copies of the 2017 Annual Fire Safety Report may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

Although this publication mainly focuses on 2016, the murder of Second Lt. Richard Collins III in 2017 has called for the entire campus to come together in order to resolve differences and reaffirm the University’s core values of diversity, inclusion, respect, and civil discourse. The University is undertaking many initiatives aimed at promoting and protecting diversity within our community, including the launch of the Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force, the development of a trained rapid-response team for hate-bias incidents, and a review of the University’s Code of Student.

For more information on how you can be part of the conversation and solution, I strongly encourage you to visit https://www.umd.edu/UMDreflects. It is through our community that opposing ideals and values can come together to form one voice for positive change.

We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, but a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

This will be facilitated through education, interaction, and open discussion. UMPD will provide an informal academy experience to the participants, with classroom activities and discussion, as well as many hands-on experiences.

The informal class setting will encourage conversation among participants and police officers. Participants will be introduced to the academic and practical aspects of a police academy and they will become familiar with such topics as traffic law, crime scene investigations, and criminal law. There will also be an opportunity to participate in ride alongs with an officer. The academy experience will also include practical exercises and scenarios faced by police officers. This will be a unique experience to bring together, in a non-confrontational, learning environment, an array of citizens who will be encouraged to express their thoughts openly and honestly. The academy experience will conclude with an academy graduation.

The CPA will be each Wednesday from 2/8/17 to 4/19/17, 7pm-10pm at the Police Training Facility. There will be no class during spring break. Interested participants should live, work, or attend school in College Park, be at least 18 years old, successfully pass a criminal history, have no prior felony convictions and no misdemeanor convictions for offenses involving weapons or violence, and have no misdemeanor or felony arrests within 1 year prior to the Community Police Academy, and sign a Consent and Release liability waiver form.

Earlier today, we were reminded that violent acts such as the one that occurred at the Ohio State University, Columbus campus can occur anywhere, and at any time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those directly affected and to the whole Ohio State University community.
Currently, there are no active threats toward our campus.  However, it is extremely important to remember that, If You See Something, Say Something.

Earlier today, we were reminded that violent acts such as the one that occurred at the Ohio State University, Columbus campus can occur anywhere, and at any time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those directly affected and to the whole Ohio State University community.

Currently, there are no active threats toward our campus. However, it is extremely important to remember that, If You See Something, Say Something. While the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) trains for such tragic events, UMD students, faculty and staff must also be prepared in the event of an active shooter situation.

We encourage all UMD students, faculty, and staff to register their cell phone at www.alert.umd.edu to receive emergency text messages from UMPD.

If you find yourself in the middle of an active shooter event, your survival may depend on whether or not you have a plan. The plan doesn't have to be complicated. There are three things you can do that make a difference: RUN. HIDE. FIGHT.

For more information on Run. Hide. Fight. and what to expect from responding police officers, visit http://www.umpd.umd.edu/services/activeshooter.cfm . To request an active shooter presentation for your division, department, or student group, please contact Capt. Ecker at kecker@umpd.umd.edu .

Kaitlyn was scheduled to meet a friend at the Eppley Recreation Center at approximately 5 p.m. to go on a hiking trip. When Kaitlyn did not show up, her friend came to the police station to report her missing.

Here is what our investigation has revealed thus far:

On November 10, 2016, security footage showed Kaitlyn leaving Allegany Hall at approximately 4:42 p.m., with a camping style backpack and a pink bag.

On November 10, 2016, at approximately 4:34 p.m., a white taxi cab entered campus via South Gate.

On November 10, 2016, at approximately 4:44 p.m., Kaitlyn got into a white taxi cab in front of Annapolis Hall by herself and on her own accord.

Investigators located and interviewed the taxi cab driver. Kaitlyn was dropped off in front of a Marina in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Baltimore City.

UMPD investigators met with the Baltimore City Police Department investigators to review security footage from the Marina. Security footage indicated that just after being dropped off by the taxi cab, she appeared to get into another waiting vehicle (SUV) on her own accord and by herself.

A witness reported seeing Kaitlyn on a Charm City Circulator bus on November 11, 2016, at approximately 8:40 a.m. Investigators interviewed this witness and verified this sighting.

Investigators continue to follow up on investigative leads and tips.

We have no reason to suspect foul play in this case. Our team of investigators will continue to work on this case until we have located Kaitlyn and have verified that she is okay. Anyone with information on Kaitlyn's whereabouts is asked to call the University of Maryland Police Department at 301-405-3555.

On October 6, 2016 at 1:58 p.m. University Police received a report of a possible armed subject near Ritchie Coliseum. Officers met with the students who reported seeing the individual and verified seeing the man with what they believed was an AR-15 rifle. Our Security Operations Center reviewed camera footage and observed the individual enter a vehicle and leave campus. Follow-up with ROTC on campus revealed that the individual was likely a member of their unit. Because we could not immediately locate and identify this individual, we elected to issue a UMD Alert. Once the information was verified, we issued a follow-up message informing the community that the situation was resolved. The weapon carried by the individual was a rubber rifle used for training. This type of weapon is incapable of being fired. The individual is a Non-Commissioned Officer with the Marine Corps assigned to the Naval ROTC program.

To avoid becoming a victim of this extortion scheme, look for the following possible indicators:

Incoming calls come from an outside area code, sometimes from Puerto Rico with area codes (787), (939) and (856)

Calls do not come from the kidnapped victim’s phone

Callers go to great lengths to keep you on the phone

Callers prevent you from calling or locating the “kidnapped” victim

Ransom money is only accepted via wire transfer service

If you receive a phone call from someone who demands payment of a ransom for a kidnapped victim, the following should be considered:

Try to slow the situation down. Request to speak to the victim directly. Ask, “How do I know my loved one is okay?”

If they don’t let you speak to the victim, ask them to describe the victim or describe the vehicle they drive, if applicable.

Listen carefully to the voice of the kidnapped victim if they speak.

Attempt to call, text, or contact the victim via social media. Request that the victim call back from his or her cell phone.

While staying on the line with alleged kidnappers, try to call the alleged kidnap victim from another phone.

To buy time, repeat the caller’s request and tell them you are writing down the demand, or tell the caller you need time to get things moving.

Don’t directly challenge or argue with the caller. Keep your voice low and steady.

Request the kidnapped victim call back from his/her cell phone.

The reported number of sexual assaults increased from 2014, which is in part, related to the University’s awareness campaigns that encourages reporting and increases training on risk reduction and bystander intervention for sexual assault. The campus saw significant decreases in robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, and incidents of dating violence, to name a few. With the decriminalization of small amounts of Marijuana in the State of Maryland, drug referrals and arrests are at all-time lows.

The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which, by far, is the most commonly reported criminal offense on campus. Other property crimes reportable through Clery include Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson. The men and women of the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) are responsible for keeping the UMD campus safe and secure and in partnership with the Prince George’s County Police Department keeping the surrounding areas safe and secure. Programs and resources that we provide include the following, which are highlighted in the report:

Walking escorts

Closed circuit video monitoring via our Security Operations Center

Blue Light Phone (PERT)

Automated License Plate Readers

Emergency Alert System

Patrols by uniformed officers

Explosive detection K9 unit

Crime prevention programs

Criminal and traffic law enforcement, reporting, and investigation

Student Police Auxiliary

Safety Ambassadors

Emergency 911 center

In 2015, The University of Maryland announced the debut of UMD Guardian, a mobile campus safety application (app) available to all students, faculty and staff. The UMD Guardian app for Apple and Android smartphones is designed to allow users quick and easy contact with UMPD, and has additional features for increasing safety on campus. Using UMD Guardian, users can initiate a safety timer session; place a panic (emergency) call to UMPD; or text a tip to UMPD. See Pages 9-10 for more details on UMD Guardian and information on how to download and install the app.

As part of our evolving safety initiatives, in cooperation with the City of College Park, the City-University Partnership was awarded grant funds to implement a Safety Ambassador Pilot Program that began in Spring of 2016. The Program is designed to have safety ambassadors who patrol the city area with a focus on safety and hospitality – greeting visitors, giving directions, doing outreach to citizens in need, and serving as eyes and ears for the agency by reporting quality of life issues such as potholes, downed trees, outages, hazards and more; as well as reporting any suspicious activities they encounter.

The Annual Safety and Security Report is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. We hope you will read the report carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information outlined in the Annual Safety and Security Report will increase your awareness, which will promote future action. We have no greater priority than the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus, but a truly safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of everyone.

Summary of Incident

On May 21, 2016 at 1:46 a.m., the University of Maryland Police Department, Emergency Communications Center received a 911 call, routed through Prince George’s County Public Safety Communications Center, regarding a fight at the 8500 block of Boteler Lane at The Courtyards Apartments.

Officers approached the apartment, and a female resident answered the door and explained that a graduation celebration was taking place. The officers advised the resident and partygoers, who were primarily African American, of the report of fighting inside the apartment and the possible use of a baseball bat. The residents refuted the claim, and initially resisted efforts of the officers to enter the premises.

The officers entered the apartment, and discovered there was no fight in progress. A decision was made to shut down the party, which exceeded the legal capacity of the apartment. Some of the partygoers left voluntarily, and others attempted to assist in clearing the crowd out. Others stayed in the apartment and in the breezeway area and did not disperse as instructed.

As partygoers were exiting the apartment, a group of individuals surrounded a UMPD officer on the breezeway and did not comply with instructions to disperse. Two officers deployed pepper spray to disperse the crowd. According to their statements, the officers used the spray because they believed the UMPD officer was in danger. The officers noted that one individual had to be restrained by a fellow partygoer. Two individuals were identified and arrested and charged with obstructing and hindering a police officer, disorderly conduct, and failing to obey a lawful order. Those charges have subsequently been dropped by the state.

The Prince George’s County Fire Department/EMS personnel arrived to help those who were affected by pepper spray. The area became overcrowded, and several individuals did not respond to instructions by UMPD officers to disperse. This delayed the EMS personnel’s efforts to help those who needed assistance.

EMS requested additional assistance with the growing crowd. Responding to the request, a UMPD officer witnessed another officer struggling with an individual who was being uncooperative. The responding officer deployed pepper spray and the struggle ended.

The officer who deployed the pepper spray arrested the individual who he believed to be the uncooperative person. While back at UMPD Headquarters, body worn camera footage revealed that the individual arrested was not the same person involved in the struggle. UMPD released the individual without charges a short time later.

UMPD policy requires an internal administrative review in all instances of pepper spray deployment. That internal review commenced May 22 and the final report was delivered to me on July 9. I want to thank Lieutenant Leadbeter for his thorough review of this incident.

Findings

The administrative review, led by Lieutenant Leadbeter, included 26 interviews and statements from UMPD officers, PGPD officers, EMS personnel, and partygoers, and careful review of all body cam video and other footage captured by partygoers.

The administrative review concluded that the deployments of pepper spray fell within UMPD use of force guidelines. However, the review concluded that the manner of deployment during the second spray did not meet UMPD standards. Even in instances when the deployment of pepper spray to disperse a crowd is considered reasonable, it still must be applied correctly.

A separate, criminal investigation determined the original 911 call to be a false call. The false call for a potential fight involving a weapon, made in retaliation because the individuals were denied entry to the party, bears significant responsibility for subsequent events. Therefore, UMPD has obtained a criminal summons against the individuals who made the false call.

Conclusions

While the administrative review focused on the deployment of the pepper spray, we are able to draw several additional lessons from the report and from the review of the body cam video.

As it is the responsibility of all UMPD police officers to protect and serve our community, we must exhibit exemplary judgement to deescalate difficult situations. Throughout the May 21 incident, we should have handled the situation with more diplomacy. It is my opinion that the subsequent deployment of pepper spray could have been avoided. This did not have to happen.

Furthermore, even in instances when the deployment of pepper spray is considered reasonable, it must be applied correctly. In the May 21 incident, the second deployment was determined to not meet our standards.

Our mission is to serve the university community, protect life and property, and to enforce the law. To be successful in that mission, we must be committed partners with all members of our community – and that includes holding our entire department to very high standards of conduct and accountability. For overall conduct unbecoming an officer, including the incorrect use of pepper spray in the second deployment, I have ordered a sanction of two weeks suspension without pay against one of our officers.

This incident has created distress and anguish among the students affected and within our broader community. UMPD is committed to equity and fairness in all of our interactions with our diverse community. We will continue to work diligently toward this end, and, therefore, I have ordered training in areas of implicit bias and diversity for every officer in the department.

Additionally, I have initiated a comprehensive review of our use of force guidelines, to ensure that every officer understands the protocol for appropriate and correct use of pepper spray. I will ask the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Judge Alexander Williams, Jr., Executive Director of UMD’s Williams Center for Education, Justice and Ethics, and other members of the campus community, including students, to assist us in this policy review.

We are addressing these issues because we recognize that the trust of our campus community—particularly our African-American community – is an integral part to our collective success.

Every day, UMPD officers come to work to serve and protect our community. We all wear the uniform proudly through situations both rewarding and challenging. We remain committed to the highest level of professional standards at all times. Together with our campus community, we will continue to uphold and strengthen our mission of service.

Our Criminal Investigation Unit is actively investigating these cases. What we know is that three of the victims were playing the Pokémon Go game. The fourth victim was not playing the game but had their phone out. Items that were stolen were cell phones. We have no reason to believe that there is more than one suspect involved in these cases. The suspect is described as a male wearing a black mask and dark clothing.

These are still active investigations and when additional information become available for release, we will distribute accordingly. Individuals with any information regarding these cases are encouraged to contact UMPD at 301-405-3555.

Safety tips :

Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you.

If you see suspicious activity or behavior, call police right away.

Avoid isolation. Take a friend when playing the game and stay in well-lit areas.

Trust your instincts. They are a natural gift that tells you when something is wrong.

Don’t play the game while driving.

Do not trespass onto private property.

The question of the appropriateness of the use of pepper spray will not be resolved until the conclusion of the full investigation, and so I must withhold specific comment at this time. The deployment of pepper spray is a rare occurrence, just ten times in the last five years.

This incident is especially painful because of the issues that are roiling nationally with respect to racial profiling and police misconduct. UMPD is committed to equity and fairness in all of our interactions with our vibrant and diverse community. We will continue to work diligently toward this end.

While the investigation is underway, I would like to offer to meet with any student, individually or in small groups, for candid, off-the-record conversations. Or, if it’s easier, any student may email me directly at chief@umpd.umd.edu. Throughout my entire career here at UMD, I have valued my close relationships with students and I am committed to keeping our lines of communication open and honest.

The men and women of the University of Maryland Police Department are some of the finest officers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I know they all join me in our singular purpose to keep every member of our community safe and secure.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,other,info not available

Alexandria, VA – The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) today announced that 10 agencies have been selected to receive the 2015 IACP/Cisco Community Policing Award. The award, now in its 18th year, recognizes outstanding community policing initiatives by law enforcement agencies worldwide. Four agencies were selected as winners, five agencies were selected as finalists, and one agency was given special recognition for the use of technology in a community policing effort.

“No single factor has been more crucial to reducing crime levels than the partnership between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve,” said IACP President Richard Beary. “I applaud those recognized with this prestigious award and know that what they have created in their communities will positively impact the law enforcement community worldwide.”

Law enforcement agencies were eligible to be nominated in five categories based on population. This year’s four winners, five finalists, and the winner in the use of technology category are examples of community policing best practices.

“Community policing is vitally important to the ultimate success of law enforcement and their mission to protect and serve their communities,” said Committee Chairman Ronal Serpas, Professor at Loyola University and former New Orleans Police Superintendent. “Recent events have demonstrated that trust between law enforcement and the community it serves is essential. The agencies we are honoring today have demonstrated how incorporating the community policing philosophy into their mission has built a stronger agency, and awarded them with strong and lasting relationships with their communities.”

Cisco is proud to be a part of the IACP Community Policing Awards and all that it represents. The men and women and public safety organizations honored by this award are the embodiment of best in breed in law enforcement,” says Bob Stanberry, former Chief of Police and current Senior Law Enforcement Advisor for Cisco, for the Community Policing Awards. “I am honored to support these organizations and am in awe of their determination to make our communities and citizens safer.”

Award winners will be honored at the IACP’s 122st Annual Conference in Chicago, Illinois, at a special awards reception at Petterino’s Restaurant on Sunday, October 25, 2015. Further information on Community Policing and how to submit for the 2016 award is available online at www.theiacp.org or on the IACP Community Policing Committee website at www.iacpcommunitypolicing.org. The site is a community policing resource for law enforcement practitioners.

The success of this event would not be possible without the continued support from sponsors, volunteers, riders, and donations. However, remembrance and support doesn’t end with this event, but continues year round.

In May of this year, Corporal John Fitzgerald, a member of UMPD’s Explosives Detection K-9 unit, traveled over 250 miles on bicycle along with additional officers from various agencies during Police Week 2015. The Police Unity Tour ride honored officers who died in the line of duty and raised money for the National Law Enforcement Officer’s Memorial and Museum.

Cpl. Fitzgerald along with members of Chapter 9 of the Police Unity Tour, began their journey on May 9, and departed from the Philadelphia area. Over 100 cyclists from Chapter 9 made their trek over the next four days, making pit stops to rest and fuel up, where they finally reached their final destination; the National Law Enforcement Officer’s Memorial in downtown Washington D.C. on May 12, 2015. In total, the ride, which consists of multiple chapters, raised over 1.9 million dollars for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and Museum this year.

Though it wasn’t a requirement, Cpl. Fitzgerald rode in memory of a fallen Police Officer Michael S. Nickerson, who would have been 40 years old this year and served with the Centreville Police Department. Unfortunately, his tour of duty came to an abrupt end on February 13, 2001. Cpl. Fitzgerald rode his bike those four days with a picture of Officer Nickerson on front of his bike. Always remembering his fallen brother but never forgetting the ultimate sacrifice he made that day. If there was one word Cpl. Fitzgerald used to describe his ride, it’s that is was “Humbling.” Coupling his passion for fitness, cycling and his profession, Cpl. Fitzgerald explained, “I’m a police officer and I can honor those who gave everything and humbling experience the appreciation the survivors have for us and what better way than cycling and that (police work).”

Officer Nickerson graduated from UMPD’s Police Academy, Session XV in 1997, where upon graduation he reported to his home agency at Centreville PD and served his community until his untimely death. Inside our Police Academy building a plaque is posted in memorial that not only Cpl. Fitzgerald sees everyday but every officer and visitor that enters our building sees. Our building which is dedicated in honor of Officer Nickerson, the plaque displays a picture of the young officer, smiling. A memorial that serves as a constant reminder for Cpl. Fitzgerald when he comes in early to work out before shift and is tired. He sees that plaque outside his office door, that young officer greeting him with a smile and saying to him, “What’s your excuse? Get it done.” A constant reminder of never knowing what is going to happen next and to be prepared. As for Cpl. Fitzgerald he will continue to ride in the Police Unity Tour every year, because to him, and like so many that share his passion, it’s worth it.

Unfortunately, Officer Nickerson’s death is just one of too many that is killed in the line of duty. As mother of slain Officer Nickerson and President of the Maryland Chapter of C.O.P.S., Sue Nickerson knows this feeling all too well. But one thing is for certain, that it’s important to remember and honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, but equally as important is to take care of the families that lost their love one.

Please follow these guidelines on game days.","Great games start with good sportsmanship, and good sportsmanship starts in the parking lots. UMD wants to provide a safe and family friendly environment for all game attendees. Please follow these guidelines on game days.

Plan ahead. Pack food, water, and other non-alcoholic beverages to enjoy prior to the game. Focus on camaraderie and share your UMD spirit with family and friends.

Make sure to bring your designated game-day parking pass, and follow parking guidelines. Use landscaped areas or space immediately in front of your car, while still allowing vehicle access through the lots. This allows emergency vehicles to pass as needed.

Grills are NOT allowed in parking garages.

Know the stadium restrictions, and don’t bring items to the gates that aren’t allowed. Prohibited items include alcohol, weapons, food, strollers, and umbrellas.

Check out TERPTOWN and get to the game early and enjoy seeing the band march in, and check out the stadium amenities to avoid a last minute rush at the gate.

There are some things you should know about alcohol consumption.

All alcohol must be consumed prior to entry into the stadium. Alcohol consumption is NOT ALLOWED while in line at entry gates.

Public consumption of alcohol in the parking lots while the game is being played is not allowed. If you are here for a Maryland Athletic event, you should be attending the event.

Common containers, such as beer kegs, and party balls, are prohibited on University of Maryland property. Excessive quantities of alcohol will be subject to removal or confiscation.

The University of Maryland Police Department differentiates between a “tailgate” and a “party” and a party may be disbanded and attendees removed from the lots. UMPD alcohol enforcement efforts at the games will continue to locate and identify these parties and hold individuals and or entities accountable for illegal activities.

A tailgate has a variety of food and beverages, including non-alcoholic beverages, available in sufficient quantities for the number of people attending.

A party has some of the following characteristics:

Common containers such as kegs, party balls, large containers of mixed drinks, beer tubs, trash cans of beer

Loud music

Drinking games

Underage drinkers

Lack of food

Large or excessive quantities of alcohol

Large numbers of people

College Park, MD – Members of the University of Maryland Police Department arrested a male for weapon violation after fleeing from officers. On August 5th, 2104, at approximately 1:28 a.m., a UMPD officer noticed the operator of a motor scooter commit several traffic infractions along Southbound Baltimore Avenue towards Lehigh Road. The officer attempted to stop the scooter when the operator sideswiped the officer’s police cruiser, causing minor damage to the cruiser. The operator of the scooter was seen discarding an item before fleeing from police onto campus. An officer located a 9mm handgun in the roadway with a round in the chamber and a loaded magazine. Additional officers pursued the male onto campus as our Security Operation Center cameras were able to track the male’s movements and keep responding officers updated on the male’s location until the male was apprehended by officers near Tawes Hall.

Christopher Ealey was arrested and charged with various traffic offenses, criminal charge CR 4-203 1 0175 Handgun in vehicle, CR 4-203 1 5212 Handgun on person, and PS 5-133(b) 1 1106 Registration firearm: Illegal possession.

Whether you are leaving your residence for vacation or just going out for the day or night, we want our community to continually be proactive in crime prevention by protecting not only your residence but by being aware of your surroundings wherever you may go. Be Smart, Be Safe! See Something, Say Something!

Protecting your residence while you are away:

If possible, stop mail and newspaper deliveries.

Place lights on a timer to give the appearance of someone being home.

Take valuable items such as jewelry, money, portable electronic devices, etc., with you to avoid potential theft.

Double-check to be sure all windows and doors are locked and secured before you leave.

Ask a friend or a trusted neighbor to keep an eye on your residence while you are away.

Set your alarm to your security system.

If you are leaving your vehicle for a long period of time, remove items of value, secure windows and doors, and if you have a security feature, engage it.

Store away and secure any loose items that might be in the yard, for example, a ladder, tools, etc.

Never enter your residence if you see that a door or window has been forced open. Go to the nearest safe place and contact the local police immediately.

Protecting your residence while you are here:

Keep doors and windows locked, regardless of whether they are an upper or lower level windows/entrances.

Before you leave your home, check to be sure that all windows and doors locked.

Require identification from all strangers (includes delivery/repair persons and police officers). If you're not sure of a person's ID, call the person’s company/agency to verify.

Never leave notes/messages on your door since they advertise that you're away and when you plan to return.

Don't ever tell anyone that you are home alone.

Use blinds and drapes for privacy.

Ensure bushes are trimmed back to remove hiding places for potential criminals.

Ensure your home has good interior and exterior lighting for safety and protection.

Always have car/house keys in hand before exiting secured areas.

Keep hands free of excessive packages/bulky items when you’re travelling to/from your home.

Never enter your home if you see that a door or window has been forced. Go to the nearest safe place and contact the local police immediately.

Never place a key over your doorway or under a flower pot, etc. If you think you may need access to a spare key, consider leaving a key with a trusted friend or neighbor.

Be Smart, Be Safe! See Something, Say Something! Wherever you may be this summer.

Stay alert and be aware of your surroundings and the surroundings of your friends. Don’t walk, ride, or drive distracted. Put down the phone, take the ear buds/headphones out/off and look where you are going.

Leave the party with friends. They’re not having a good time, either.

See Something, Say Something! No matter where you go this summer, 911 is the same in all 50 states. If traveling internationally, plan ahead and find out what phone number is used in case of an emergency. You can also visit http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html for more information about alerts and warnings for international travel.

Save the bingeing for Netflix. Seriously, stop drinking before you forget how much you’ve been drinking.

After dark, walk with others and use well-lit paths.

Take it with you. Don’t leave property unsecured.

Do not carry your name, address, or license on your key ring.

Be aware of vehicles with their headlights off or that slow down near you. If you feel you are being followed, contact the police immediately.

Don’t advertise your plans on social media.

Pedestrian & Cyclists Safety Tips:

Stay visible after dark. Avoid wearing dark clothing when going out at night, especially in inclement weather.

Watch for Signs. Wait for the “Walk” signal to begin crossing. Don’t cross against the pedestrian signal.

Go Cross-Eyed. Look left, right and left again before stepping into the crosswalk.

Always use the crosswalk. Don’t Jaywalk.

Get Your Shine On. Make yourself visible when out at night with reflective gear or lights.

Be Headstrong. Protect your noggin with a helmet.

Go with the Flow. Never ride against traffic.

Use Hand Signals (The Nice Kind). Drivers need to know what turn you’re taking.

Additional Safety Tips & Resources:

As our Criminal Investigations Until continues to investigate these incidents, we ask that you continue to practice and instill into your daily routine the safety tips listed below.

Safety Tips:

Keep your room door locked, when you’re asleep, down the hall, in the shower, or visiting others in your building.

Make sure doors close and latch behind you. If you are at a resident hall and noticed that a door is not securing properly, please contact 301-314-9675. For all other buildings contact 301-405-3555.

Students should be cognizant of tailgaters who attempt to gain access into a building, dorm, or facility by walking in with the person who rightfully enters. All persons that are allowed access to a dorm are issued swipe access cards or keys allowing them entry. This includes faculty, staff, workers, and temporary workers. All will have their own means of making entry and should not feel offended if questioned by students.

If you feel comfortable approaching an individual who is seen on your floor unaccompanied and feel comfortable questioning them as to why they are there, make sure to report the incident to the Service Desk or an RA or call police immediately. If you don't feel comfortable approaching an individual who is seen on your floor alone, immediately notify your Service Desk or an RA or call police.

If you observe suspicious activity or observe a person behaving in a suspicious manner, contact the police immediately by calling #3333 from a mobile phone or 301-405-3333.

Beware of your surroundings. Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you.

The University of Maryland Police Department kindly reminds our UMD Community that being proactive in safety and security is essential. You might be on vacation, but safety and security never takes a vacation. Please take a moment and familiarize yourself with the below listed safety tips and information.

Protecting your residence while you’re away:

If possible, stop mail and newspaper deliveries.

Place lights on a timer to give the appearance of someone being home.

Take valuable items such as jewelry, money, portable electronic devices, etc., with you to avoid potential theft.

Double-check to be sure all windows and doors are locked and secured before you leave.

Ask a friend or a trusted neighbor to keep an eye on your residence while you are away.

If you have one, set your alarm to your security system.

If you are leaving your vehicle for a long period of time, remove items of value, secure windows and doors, and if you have a security feature, engage it.

Store away and secure any loose items that might be in the yard, for example, a ladder, tools, etc.

Never enter your residence if you see that a door or window has been forced open. Go to the nearest safe place and contact the local police immediately.

Safety tips that can be used anywhere: Be Smart, Be Safe!

Leave the party with friends. They’re not having a good time, either.

Look up from your phone. Snapchat can wait.

See Something, Say Something! No matter where you go this spring break, 911 is the same in all 50 states. If traveling internationally, plan ahead and find out what phone number is used in case of an emergency. You can also visit http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html for more information about alerts and warnings for international travel.

Save the bingeing for Netflix. Seriously, stop drinking before you forget how much you’ve been drinking.

Stay visible after dark. Use lights on your bicycle or wear reflective clothing when out at night. Avoid wearing dark clothing when going out.

Go cross-eyed. Look left, right and left again before stepping into the crosswalk.

After dark, walk with other and use well-lit paths.

Take it with you. Don’t leave property unsecured.

Do not carry your name, address, or license on your key ring.

Be aware of your surroundings. Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you-Electronic devices that block your hearing or split your attention make it difficult for you to remain vigilant.

If you feel you are being followed, contact the police immediately.

Don’t advertise your plans on social media.

In addition to the safety information listed above, for those remaining in town, here are some additional safety reminders and resources:

Blue Light Phones are available for emergency situations and to request a walking escort.

Be aware of your surroundings. Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you - electronic devices that block your hearing or split your attention make it difficult for you to remain vigilant.

Secure your office. When you go down the hall, to the restroom, or visiting others in your building.

If you observe suspicious activity or behavior, contact the police immediately by calling #3333 from a mobile phone or 301-405-3333.

Be aware of vehicles with their headlights off or that slow down near you.

The purpose of the training exercise is to provide participants an opportunity to demonstrate the response plans, policies, and procedure for responding to an active shooter at the University of Maryland.

A UMD Text Alert was sent out to inform the campus community of a Police training exercise taking place at the ERC. If an actual incident is occurring on campus, a UMD Text Alert would be sent with information to the campus community informing them what is going on and what to do. When officers entered ERC, they were greeted by sounds of blanks being fired off to simulate the sound of gun shots and as well as the smell of gun powder. Students volunteered as victims with injuries as well as witnesses, making the exercise more conducive to what officers may encounter in an actual event. Even though the training exercise was in a controlled environment, officers were presented with factors that they would encounter in an actual event; making the training exercise as real as possible without compromising participant's safety.

With every active shooter, the goal is to eliminate the threat in the least amount of time as possible with the fewest amount of casualties as possible. We conduct these training exercises to train and prepare for the worst but hope for the best. If you are unsure of what to do in an active shooter incident, please visit http://www.umd.edu/emergencypreparedness/guides/activeshooter.cfm , where general information is listed about active shooters, safety tips, and a short video about Run, Hide, and Fight!

As finals come to an end and the winter break approaches, the University of Maryland Police Department would like provide some safety tips and crime prevention tools. We hope this information serves as a reminder of what you can do to reduce your chance of becoming a victim of a crime and to help you remain safe during the winter break.

If you will be home or at your UMD residence this winter break here are some tips to help you stay safe this season:

Keep doors and windows locked, regardless of whether they are an upper or lower level windows/entrances.

Before you leave your home, check to be sure that all windows and doors locked.

Require identification from all strangers (includes delivery/repair persons and police officers). If you're not sure of a person's ID, call the person’s company/agency to verify.

Never leave notes/messages on your door since they advertise that you're away and when you plan to return.

Don't ever tell anyone that you are home alone.

Use blinds and drapes for privacy.

Ensure bushes are trimmed back to remove hiding places for potential criminals.

Ensure your home has good interior and exterior lighting for safety and protection.

Always have car/house keys in hand before exiting secured areas.

Keep hands free of excessive packages/bulky items when you’re travelling to/from your home.

Never enter your home if you see that a door or window has been forced. Go to the nearest safe place and contact the local police immediately.

Never place a key over your doorway or under a flower pot, etc. If you think you may need access to a spare key, consider leaving a key with a trusted friend or neighbor.

Don’t display presents under the tree if they can be seen from a window.

If you will be away for all or part of this winter break, below are some safety tips to consider:

Stop mail and newspaper deliveries.

Place lights on a timer to give the appearance of someone being home.

Take valuable items such as jewelry, money, portable electronic devices, etc., with you to avoid potential theft.

Double-check to be sure all windows and doors are locked and secured before you leave.

Ask a friend or a trusted neighbor to keep an eye on your residence while you are away.

Set your alarm to your security system.

If you are leaving your vehicle for a long period of time, remove items of value, secure windows and doors, and if you have a security feature, engage it.

Store away and secure any loose items that might be in the yard, for example, a ladder, tools, etc.

With winter comes below freezing temperatures; disconnect the garden hose if it is still connected to the outside faucet.

And last minute shopping tips:

Stay alert and be aware of your surroundings.

Walk in well-lit, populated areas; avoid cut-through paths and short-cuts.

Try to park in busy, well-lit areas and avoid parking beside large vehicles which can obstruct views.

Lock your car doors and place all valuables in the trunk or under the seats.

Avoid carrying large sums of cash. Pay with a check, debit card, or credit cards.

Keep your purse closed and close to your body and/or carry your wallet in an inside coat or front pants pocket.

Listed below is updated information regarding the incident from Montgomery County Police Department.

On October 3rd, 2013, Montgomery County Police received information regarding a sexual assault that had occurred in Gaithersburg between the night of October 2nd and the morning of October 3rd. Investigation revealed that the victim had met the suspect at a bar, Looney’s, in College Park, Maryland. The suspect and victim then went to the suspect’s residence in Gaithersburg where the sexual assault occurred. Joey Poindexter, age 38, of the 8400 block of Plum Creek Drive was arrested on October 9th and is currently being held on bond.

Further investigation by detectives revealed that there are likely additional victims of sexual assault by Joey Poindexter. Digital images depicting young college age men who appear unconscious and are in compromising positions were discovered. Poindexter attends organized Beer Pong events held throughout the greater Washington DC and Baltimore region and has met several of his victims at these events. Joey Poindexter is also known to frequent activities involving young adult population such as extreme sporting events (BMX and skateboarding competitions). Joey Poindexter has recently traveled to New Jersey, Las Vegas NV, Dallas TX, Virginia Beach VA, and Salt Lake City UT. It is believed most of the assaults occurred when the victim is unconscious or significantly impaired from alcohol, although the possibility of drug use has not been ruled out. All of the identified victims are heterosexual and did not have any indications of what was going to occur prior to the assault.

Detectives believe that Joey Poindexter is a sexual predator that has been victimizing young college aged adult males for approximately 10 years. Additional victims have been located and additional charges are forthcoming. Anyone with information is asked to please contact the Montgomery County Police Major Crimes Division at 240-773-5070. MCPD is the primary agency investigating this case. For media inquiries call MCPD at 240-773-5030.

Why is it important to do a Drop, Cover, and Hold On drill? To react quickly you must practice often. You may only have seconds to protect yourself in an earthquake, before strong shaking knocks you down--or drops something on you. Practicing helps you be ready to respond.
•If you are inside a building, move no more than a few steps, then Drop, Cover and Hold On: ?DROP to the ground (before the earthquake drops you!),
	?Take COVER by getting under a sturdy desk or table, and
	?HOLD ON to it until the shaking stops.
Stay indoors till the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit. In most buildings in the Southeast you are safer if you stay where you are until the shaking stops.
•If you are outdoors when the shaking starts, you should find a clear spot away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and power lines, then Drop, Cover and Hold On.

•If you are driving, pull over to a clear location, stop and stay there with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops. Once the shaking stops, proceed with caution and avoid bridges or ramps that might have been damaged.

Ground shaking during an earthquake is seldom the cause of injury.

Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths are caused by collapsing walls and roofs, flying glass and falling objects. It is extremely important for a person to move as little as possible to reach the place of safety he or she has identified because most injuries occur when people try to move more than a short distance during the shaking.

Look around you now, before an earthquake. Identify safe places such as under a sturdy piece of furniture or against an interior wall in your home, office or school so that when the shaking starts you can respond quickly. An immediate response to move to the safe place can save lives. And that safe place should be within a few steps to avoid injury from flying debris.

What we do now, before a big earthquake, will determine what our lives will be like afterwards. With earthquakes an inevitable part of the South East’s future, we must act quickly to ensure that disasters do not become catastrophes.

Great ShakeOut drills worldwide involved over 23 million people through broad-based outreach programs, media partnerships, and public advocacy by partners in each region. The drill is held statewide annually on the third Thursday of October, and is organized by the Earthquake Country Alliance (www.earthquakecountry.org).

The 2013 Great SouthEast ShakeOut earthquake drill will be at 10:17 a.m. on October 17.

A key aspect of the ShakeOut is the integration of comprehensive science-based earthquake research and the lessons learned from decades of social science research about why people get prepared. The result is a “teachable moment” on par with having an actual earthquake (often followed by increased interest in getting ready for earthquakes). ShakeOut creates the sense of urgency that is needed for people, organizations, and communities to get prepared, to practice what to do to be safe, and to learn what plans need to be improved.

The 2013 ShakeOut drill will be the largest preparedness event in U.S. history.

Both the caller and the individual in need of medical assistance are covered by the policy. The policy is intended to promote responsible behavior while decreasing any potential disciplinary punishments that may be a deterrent to calling for emergency medical assistance. For more information, read the policy here: http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/V-100J.pdf

On the bus. Stay awake and keep your personal belongings close to you. Sit near the door or the driver and stay awake. If someone’s harassing you, ask the driver to let you off at a populated bus stop or a well-lit area like a gas station.

Grab it. Close it. Lock it. College and university parking lots and structures are common targets for thieves. Never leave valuables in your car or items in plain view. Take items like GPS devices, removable stereo faceplates, and electronics with you. Make sure your windows are up and the doors are locked. Apply a security device or set the alarm.

Report solicitors. Magazine subscriptions, donation requests, spa packages and ""earn money now"" schemes are some of the common methods criminals use to take your money. Avoid solicitors’ scams by politely saying no and immediately notifying university police. Never provide a solicitor with your personal information.

Keep personal information private. Avoid becoming a victim of identity theft by carrying only the necessary items in your wallet or purse.

Keep your Residence Hall room locked. Even if you’re going next door to a friend’s room, always grab your keys and lock the door. A propped open door is a perfect target for would-be thieves and allows them quick and easy access to your belongings. If your room has additional doors and windows, always be sure they are closed and locked as well.

Protect your wheels. If you ride a bike, register your bike with the Department of Transportation Services. Registering your bike helps improve the likelihood of recovery if stolen. Invest in a high-quality, hardened steel ""U"" lock. For optimum security, lock both the front and frame to the bike rack.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,robbery,on_campus

NHTSA has released the following information on aggressive driving and ways to combat it. Please keep this information in mind as you travel and stay safe.

Are You an Aggressive Driver?

Do You:

• Express Frustration. Taking out your frustrations on your fellow motorists can lead to violence or a crash.

• Fail to Pay Attention when Driving. Reading, eating, drinking or talking on the phone, can be a major cause of roadway crashes.

• Tailgate. This is a major cause of crashes that can result in serious deaths or injuries.

• Make Frequent Lane Changes. If you whip in and out of lanes to advance ahead, you can be a danger to other motorists.

• Run Red Lights. Do not enter an intersection on a yellow light. Remember flashing red lights should be treated as a stop sign.

• Speed. Going faster than the posted speed limit, being a “road racer” and going too fast for conditions are some examples of speeding.

Life in the Fast Lane

Plan Ahead, Allow Yourself Extra Time

• Concentrate. Don’t allow yourself to become distracted by talking on your cellular phone, eating, drinking or putting on makeup.

• Relax. Tune the radio to your favorite relaxing music. Music can calm your nerves and help you to enjoy your time in the car.

• Drive the Posted Speed Limit. Fewer crashes occur when vehicles are travelling at or about the same speed.

• Identify Alternate Routes. Try mapping out an alternate route. Even if it looks longer on paper, you may find it is less congested.

• Use Public Transportation. Public transportation can give you some much-needed relief from life behind the wheel.

• Just be Late. If all else fails, just be late.

Officials forecast precipitation mixing with and changing to snow Tuesday night and continuing into Wednesday evening with temperatures in the lower and mid-30s and winds 10 to 20 MPH with gusts up to 30 MPH.  Uncertainty remains with the track of the low pressure front and location of the rain-snow line which ultimately will determine snowfall totals.  Potential impacts include difficult driving conditions, heavy, wet snow, and gusty winds leading to power outages.","The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Watch for the Baltimore-Washington area—meaning there is a potential for significant snow, sleet, or ice accumulation--in effect from Tuesday evening through Wednesday evening, with the possibility of snow accumulations of more than five inches and a potential for significant snowfall within the watch area. Officials forecast precipitation mixing with and changing to snow Tuesday night and continuing into Wednesday evening with temperatures in the lower and mid-30s and winds 10 to 20 MPH with gusts up to 30 MPH. Uncertainty remains with the track of the low pressure front and location of the rain-snow line which ultimately will determine snowfall totals. Potential impacts include difficult driving conditions, heavy, wet snow, and gusty winds leading to power outages.

The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang has dubbed this storm “Snowquester;” though meteorologists continue to watch the forecast models to assess potential accumulation, there seems to be consensus that there will be snow Wednesday. The Weather Channel has dubbed this Winter Storm Saturn, and predicts significant travel impacts to include flight delays that may ripple through the East Coast through Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, even if significant storm impacts remain in the Mid-Atlantic area. Snow is likely Wednesday, with rain or snow mainly east of I-95. The snow could be heavy at times. But if the storm tracks too far south, lighter precipitation would be expected, and more rain may mix with the snow, even west of I-95. Snow and/or rain tapers off Wednesday night, with lows 30-34 (suburbs-city).

A summary of snow accumulation predictions:

Chance of 2” or more: 70-80 percent

Chance of 5” or more: 45-60 percent

Chance of 10” or more: 10-30 percent

Note: The low end of the ranges apply to D.C./I-95 and points east, while the higher end of the ranges apply to areas west of D.C. and I-95 (where the accumulation potential is greater due to colder temperatures).

The issue of your safety on and around campus is always of concern for us. Since 2006, the UMD College Park Campus has seen a continual decrease in violent crime both on and off campus. To continue this trend I am asking that you take to heart these very important safety tips.

Before you leave your residence or go to sleep for the night, check to be sure that all windows and doors are locked.

Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you - electronic devices that block your hearing or split your attention make it difficult for you to remain vigilant.

Avoid isolation. After dark, walk with others and use well-lit paths. Department of Public Safety escort services are available 24/7 at 301-405-3555.

If you feel you are being followed, contact the police immediately. Prevent people from tailgating into the building by ensuring the door closes as soon as possible after you enter.

If you observe suspicious behavior, report it to police immediately by dialing 301-405-3555 or #3333 from a mobile device.

Note the locations of the Blue Light Emergency Phones and look for them as you walk.

RUN, HIDE, FIGHT

Run

If you can get out, do so

Always try to escape or evacuate, don't let others slow you down with indecision

Getting yourself out of harms way is your #1 priority

Once you're out of the line of fire, call for help Use 911 (Dialing 911 from a campus phone will connect with DPS. Dialing 911 from a cell phone will connect you with Prince George's County Communications. Be sure to give the call taker your exact location. Use 301-405-3333 to contact UMD Public Safety (Emergency Line)



Hide

If you can't get out safely, you need to find a place to hide

Act quickly and quietly

Try to secure your hiding place as best you can

Turn out lights and lock doors

Silence your cell phone

If you can't find a safe room or closet, try to conceal yourself behind large objects that may protect you.

Do your best to remain calm

Fight

As a last resort, if your life is at risk, whether alone or working together as a group, FIGHT!

Act with aggesion

Improvise weapons

Disarm the shooter

Commit to taking the shooter down, no matter what.

Remember ... RUN, HIDE, FIGHT

What to expect from responding police officers

Police officers responding to an active shooter are trained to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. The first responding officers will normally be in teams; they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might also be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. Regardless of how they appear, remain calm, do as the officers tell you, and do not be afraid of them. Put down any bags or packages you may be carrying and keep your hands visible at all times; if you know where the shooter is, tell the officers. The first officers to arrive will not stop to aid injured people; rescue teams composed of other officers and emergency medical personnel will follow the first officers into secured areas to treat and remove injured persons. Keep in mind that even once you have escaped to a safer location, the entire area is still a crime scene; police will usually not let anyone leave until the situation is fully under control and all witnesses have been identified and questioned. Until you are released, remain at whatever assembly point authorities designate.",2024-07-13T21:30:03.693038+00:00,gas_line,info not available

Often this occurs as a result of identifying individuals who have committed crimes on the campus, whether they be property crimes or crimes against persons.  These denials of access, which are typically issued immediately following an arrest, makes the person subject to immediate arrest if he or she returns to the campus without permission.  This gives an extra level of protection against repeat offenders returning to the campus where the crime was committed.
From sharing information about arrests between university police departments, it became evident that some criminals who target one university campus, also target others.  With this in mind, the UMD College Park, UMD Baltimore County, and Towson University police departments entered into an agreement to share denial of access data.","When it comes to preventing crime on college campuses, University police departments in Maryland have a very important tool in their arsenal -- the ability to bar individuals involved in criminal activity from property owned by the institution.

The UMD College Park PD Information Technology Unit, in cooperation with Capital Wireless Information Net (CAPWIN), is leading an effort to connect institutions of higher education all over the Maryland region in order to share a database of known individuals who were issued either a Denial of Access or a Trespassing charge for each respective campus. A database was created and managed by the University of Maryland College Park police department to which UMBC and Towson University securely upload data on individuals denied access to their university campuses. As a result of this, police officers from any law enforcement agency will have immediate access to information via CAPWIN Mobile pertaining to any current denials of access at any of the participating campuses.

The department and officers were recognized today at a ceremony hosted by the Governor’s Office of Crime Control and Prevention. Ms. Gloria Aparicio Blackwell, Mr. Gerry Sneeringer, both UMD Staff, and Mr. Charles L. Simpson Jr, Manager of Southern Management (Graduate Hills and Gardens) won the “Category C – Governor’s Crime Prevention Award for Community Groups, Organizations, and Individual Citizens.

The award for Outstanding Crime Prevention contributions was awarded to community groups, organizations, and individual citizens in Maryland who, as judged by the Awards Subcommittee, made outstanding contributions to the furtherance of crime prevention in their communities. Ms. Aparicio-Blackwell was recognized for her efforts in community engagement and programs which assist local youth. These partnerships have fostered valuable on-going relationships between the University of Maryland Police and the local community. Mr. Sneeringer was nominated for the award for his long-hours work in assisting UMDPS with a criminal case in which an individual made threats over the internet -- that he was going to ""shoot up"" the campus. Mr. Sneeringer's expertise in IT enabled detectives to locate the person making the threats and safely take him into custody. Mr. Simpson, Jr., as manager for Southern Management, worked with his company and made special accomodations to house a Police Community Office at the Graduate Hills Apartments complex on Tulane Drive. The incorporation of this office into the Graduate Housing complex has helped create dialog between our Crime Prevention Officer (Sgt. Kenner) and the community members on safety issues in the surrounding area.

“These individuals have done a great service to our community” stated David B. Mitchell, Chief of Police. “I look forward to continued successes that members of our community contribute to the University of Maryland College Park campus and the surrounding community.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

University of Maryland Department of Public Safety Publishes 2012 Annual Security Report

COLLEGE PARK, Maryland - The University of Maryland Department of Public Safety announces the publication of the 2012 Annual Security Report. The Annual Security Report provides safety and security information to current and prospective University of Maryland students as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report.

""This is an excellent way by which we are able to highlight the security resources available to the University community,” said David Mitchell, University Police Chief. ""I urge the University community to read the report and be aware of, and more importantly, take advantage of security services on campus,” Mitchell added.

In addition to outlining the different security resources the campus has to offer, the report also provides statistics on area crime reported to on- and off-campus law enforcement agencies as well as to several University departments which report data back to the Department of Public Safety.

Of note in these statistics is the continuing downward trend in reports of violent crime both on and off campus. Reductions were seen in crimes such as:

Forcible sex offense- 10 in 2010 to 5 in 2011

Aggravated assault- 15 in 2010 to 4 in 2011

Robbery- 10 in 2010 to 7 in 2011

Overall Violent Crime- 54% Reduction from 2010 to 2011

All of these incidents include data from the local area surrounding the UMD College Park campus, and also includes reports made to non-law enforcement entities.

The Clery Act does not require the reporting of statistics for the crime of theft, which is, by far, the most commonly reported criminal offense on campus. UMD saw a decrease in reports of theft on campus dropping about 11% from 2010 to 2011 (199 in 2011 compared with 225 reported in 2010). Other property crimes reportable through Clery include Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson; all of which showed reductions from 2010 to 2011.

The University of Maryland Department of Public Safety (UMDPS) is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for policing the University of Maryland College Park campus. Programs and resources provided by UMDPS include walking escorts; closed circuit video monitoring; patrols by uniformed officers; explosive detection K9 unit; emergency alerts; crime prevention programs; criminal and traffic law enforcement, reporting and investigation; Student Police Auxiliary; and an Emergency 911 center. These programs are highlighted within the Annual Security Report.

Other campus safety and security resources include services provided by many other University departments such as the Department of Resident Life, Residential Facilities, Environmental Safety, Transportation Services (Shuttle-UM), Health Center, Office of Student Conduct, and Counseling Center to name a few. The Annual Security Report goes into further detail about the programs and services of these departments.

“Reviewing the information outlined in this brochure will increase your awareness, and awareness is the precursor to action” stated Mitchell.

These officers are Sgt. J. Brown, MPO Mable, PFC Powers, PFC Meekins, and Pvt. Dykstra. Also, congratulations are in order for Sgt. J. Brown, for defending his title and becoming the two-time donut eating champion! Sgt. J. Brown was the first to eat four whole donuts in three minutes. A special thanks to the proprietor and staff of the College Park Dunkin Donuts for giving us the space and for donating donuts and coffee (everyone who donated was offered a free coffee). Without you this event would not have been possible. Finally, a big thanks to the event organizers, Sgt. P. Miller and A/Sgt. R. Hoaas who made all of this possible. Without your time, effort, dedication, and energy, we wouldn’t be where we are at today. I am extremely proud that our Department placed second out of seven in the total money raised in the Dunkin’ Doughnuts part of the competition. To all who took part: Thank you on behalf of the more than 10,000 Special Olympic athletes in Maryland! -- David B. Mitchell, Chief of Police September 19, 2012 COPS TAKE TO THE ROOFTOP OF COLLEGE PARK DUNKIN’ DONUTS LOCATION IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS MARYLAND

College Park, MD - Police Officers from the University of Maryland Department of Public Safety will collect donations for Special Olympics Maryland on the rooftop of the College Park Dunkin’ Donuts the weekend of Sept. 29th - 30th, 2012.

Anyone who ever thought nothing good could come from cops sitting around (or in this case ON) a donut shop might reconsider that notion when “Cops on Rooftops” – a fundraiser for Special Olympics Maryland -- comes to the College Park Dunkin’ Donuts location on Saturday, September 29th through Sunday, September 30th, 2012.

As part of a national fundraising effort for Special Olympics Maryland, five good-natured officers from the University of Maryland Police Department – Officers Brown, Dykstra, Mable, Powers and Meekins have volunteered to spend the day on the roof of Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant at 9701 Baltimore Avenue, College Park, MD. Their collective fundraising goal is $6,000.00.

In 2009, the first year a Maryland location participated in the promotion, the Laurel Dunkin’ Donuts and Laurel Police Department raised more than $7,000. In 2010, five Dunkin Donut locations partnering with law enforcement raising $30,000 for Special Olympics Maryland. In 2011, eight Dunkin’ Donuts locations across the state took part in the program: Laurel, College Park, Westminster, Towson, Reisterstown, Havre de Grace, Mount Rainier and California.

Dunkin’ Donuts customers and the general public alike are encouraged to stop by and support the officers in their efforts to raise both funds and awareness for the Law Enforcement Torch Run® for Special Olympics Maryland. Along with law enforcement volunteers who will be on the rooftop, other officers will greet customers inside and outside of the store, passing around donation jars and rallying support for the cause. There will also be a silent auction as well as a raffle for items. A merchandise table will also be set up, with Torch Run t-shirts for sale as well as raffle tickets for a 2011 Harley-Davidson XL1200 Nightster donated by Rommel of Annapolis Harley Davidson.

“Cops and donuts have a long, humorous history together, so it was only fitting that we team up with the great folks at Dunkin’ Donuts for this light-hearted event,” said David B. Mitchell, Chief of Police of the University of Maryland Police Department. “This event allows us to do something great for an incredible organization and poke a little fun at ourselves at the same time. What could be better than that?” The event was founded on the idea by the law enforcement officers of Illinois, who in 2009, took to the rooftops of 94 Dunkin’ Donuts locations across the state and raised more than $182,000.

College Park, MD - The University of Maryland Police will be hosting a site for the Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day which will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2012, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The site will be located at the front of the University of Maryland police station located on Rossborough Lane across from Ritchie Coliseum.

This is a great opportunity for those who missed the previous events, or who have subsequently accumulated unwanted, unused prescription drugs, to safely dispose of those medications. All community members are welcome to drop off unwanted, unused prescription medication.

Americans that participated in the DEA’s fourth National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day this past April turned in a record-breaking 552,161 pounds (276 tons) of unwanted or expired medications for safe and proper disposal at the 5,659 take-back sites that were available in all 50 states and U.S. territories. When the results of the four prior Take-Back Days are combined, the DEA, and its state, local, and tribal law-enforcement and community partners have removed 1.5 million pounds (774 tons) of medication from circulation. In Maryland, we had 49 agencies collect over 8,116 pounds at 104 take back sites.

The 2024 Annual Security Report (ASR) and Annual Fire Safety Report (AFSR) are available for your review.

The ASR provides safety and security resources and information to current and prospective students and their parents, as well as to faculty and staff members. Statistics comparing crime over the previous three years are outlined in the report. The ASR is a part of the effort to ensure that this collaborative endeavor is effective and is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The purpose of the AFSR report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to our on-campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities.

The Clery Act requires the University of Maryland to count and disclose crimes that occur within four general categories: criminal offenses, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) offenses and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action. Incidents reported occurred either on-campus, in non-campus buildings or property, or on public property that occurred immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes statistics on crime that occurred where university students stay while on university-sponsored travel, within the United States or abroad, and area crime reported to off-campus law enforcement agencies. Footnotes, which clarify where changes in reporting have resulted in a noticeable variance from previous years’ reports, are included in the interest of transparency.

As you review the ASR, please keep in mind that our community has options for reporting incidents that fall under the Clery Act. Incidents can be reported to police, Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), and/or confidential resources. Therefore, not all cases that were reported in the ASR were criminally investigated by law enforcement.

Printed copies of the ASR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), Pocomoke Building (007), 7569 Baltimore Ave, College Park, MD 20742 or by calling (301) 405-6399.

Printed copies of the AFSR may be requested through the mail or in person from the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk, Seneca Building, 4716 Pontiac Street, Suite 0103, College Park, Maryland 20742 or by calling (301) 405-3960.

We hope you will read the reports carefully and use the information to help foster a safer environment for you and for others within our community. Reviewing the information will increase your awareness, which will promote future action.

Theft is the most reported crime on our campus. However, we have seen have seen a rapid increase of theft, specifically, theft of e-scooters. Since September 1, 2024, we have received over 70 reports of e-scooter thefts, across different parts of campus.

E-scooters are portable, lightweight, and easy to use, making them very popular among our community. E-scooters are also appealing to others who are looking to take advantage of an opportunity.

If you own an e-scooter, please make sure you are taking the necessary precautions to safe guard your property. This includes:

Always lock your e-scooter.

Use a U-type of lock instead of a cable or chain. Cable or chain locks can be easily cut and if not secured with enough tension, cable or chain locks can be easily manipulated to which the e-scooter could be removed with ease from the lock.

Find the most secure point on your e-scooter to run your lock through. This could be through the folding mechanism on your e-scooter. Avoid using the handlebars or through the wheels or around weak points on your e-scooter.

Lock your e-scooter to a bike rack and not to a handrail, a pole, a parking post, etc.

Our department has implemented solutions that include, but not limited to, data gathering and sharing to members of the department, utilizing our Security Operations Center’s (SOC) cameras to focus in on the areas of campus in which we are seeing an increase of incidents, officers conducting more visual checks of areas that are used for e-scooter parking and parking lots, and sharing information with our neighboring police departments.

Our Criminal Investigations Unit has also identified numerous offenders and charged them. One suspect is connected to nine cases. We have created a page that shows e-scooter suspects we are looking for and people who have been charged in connection with e-scooter thefts. This page will be updated.

Crime prevention is a team effort and we need the help of our community. If you see suspicious activity, such as someone manipulating a lock with tools, like bolt cutters, call us immediately at 911 or 301-405-3333 or you can text us through the UMD Guardian app. The sooner we are aware about something, the sooner we can respond.

Safety Tips:

The University of Maryland Police Department provides a walking escort service for anyone who feels unsafe when walking on or near campus. If you would like a walking escort, please call to request one at 301-405-3555. You may also use a blue light emergency phone to call for an escort.

Stay alert and attuned to people and circumstances around you.

Trust your instincts. They are a natural gift that tells you when something is wrong.



If you observe suspicious activity or behavior, contact the police immediately by calling 911 or 301-405-3333.
