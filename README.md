# umd-alerts-bot-amahaja25

3/14 
* I created the python file for the scraper as well as the csv that i want to store the alerts in.
* Created some sort of start to the scraper, but there is more I need to work on. Starting out, I was able to get the links to the alerts and attach them to the base UMD Alerts link, get the date of the alert, as well as the title, and write this all out to the csv. 
* I need to now find a way to scrape the individual alert pages so I can get the text, and further split this up into things like location and time of incident.
* Need to split up alerts by type -- Gas Line, Robbery, Indecent Exposure, On- vs Off-Campus.
* Have to implement GitHub Actions so automate running this every minute or two minutes so I can be most up to date on the alerts.
